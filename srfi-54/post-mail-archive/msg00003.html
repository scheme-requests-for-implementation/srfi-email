<p align="center">Dear sir,</p>

<p align="center">This are some of the tragic events wich we ask you to support all those people wich houses and all 
they had it is history :</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Hurricane Rita:</strong><br />
Less than a month after Katrina, Hurricane Rita   lashed the Gulf coast and left massive devastation in its wake. The 
American Red   Cross will serve the victims of Hurricane Rita as it has done with Hurricane   Katrina, but must rely on 
the ongoing support of the American public. Your   financial gift to Hurricane Rita and continued support of Hurricane 
Katrina   relief efforts will help the Red Cross provide shelter, food, counseling and   other assistance to those 
affected by these hurricanes. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Hurricane Katrina:</strong><br />
  Victims of Hurricane Katrina are attempting to   recover from the massive storm. American Red Cross volunteers have 
been deployed   to the hardest hit areas of Katrina&rsquo;s destruction, supplying hundreds of   thousands victims left 
homeless with critical necessities. By making a financial   gift to support Hurricane Katrina Relief efforts, the Red 
Cross can provide   shelter, food, counseling and other assistance to those affected by Hurricane   Katrina. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>National Disaster Relief Fund:</strong><br />
  You can help the victims of   thousands of disasters across the country each year by making a financial gift   to the 
Disaster Relief Fund, which enables the Red Cross to provide shelter,   food, counseling and other assistance to those 
in need. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Your Local Red Cross Chapter:</strong><br />
  Your local Red Cross chapter is   committed to meeting the humanitarian needs of the people in your area, be it in   
disaster preparedness, disaster response, first aid and CPR training, or disease   prevention. You can help support 
your local chapter programs and services by a   gift to Your Local Red Cross Chapter. The gift will be sent to your 
local area   chapter based on zip code. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>International Response Fund:</strong><br />
  You can help those affected by the   West African famine and countless other crises around the world each year by   
making a financial gift to the American Red Cross International Response Fund,   which will provide immediate relief 
and long-term support through supplies,   technical assistance and other support to help those in need. For the bomb   
emergency in London, the British Red Cross has not requested assistance;   therefore the American Red Cross is not 
soliciting or accepting contributions   for this emergency. The American Red Cross has also announced that the needs   
have been met for its tsunami relief program. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Military Services:</strong><br />
  The American Red Cross is a lifeline for   deployed military members, allowing them to communicate to loved ones back 
home   during emergencies. You can help the Red Cross keep military families connected   with a gift to Red Cross 
Military Services. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Biomedical Services Capital Campaign:</strong><br />
  Your gift to the Biomedical   Services Capital Campaign of the American Red Cross supports our commitment to   the 
nation's blood supply. Through this 10-year undertaking we will update and   reconfigure our blood manufacturing 
facilities across the nation, to better   serve the health needs of patients nationwide. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Measles Initiative:</strong><br />
  Through the Measles Initiative, the American   Red Cross and its partners pledge to, by the end of 2005, vaccinate 
200 million   children and prevent an estimated 1.2 million measles-related deaths in Africa.   You can support this 
lifesaving effort by making a donation to the Measles   Initiative today. </p>

<p align="center">The American Red Cross is not a government agency and all Red Cross disaster   assistance is free 
thanks to the generosity of people like you.The value of your   donation is increased by the fact that the ratio of 
volunteer Red Cross workers   to paid staff is almost 36 to one. <br clear="all" />
  Contributions to the American   Red Cross, a tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal   
Revenue Code, are deductible for computing income and estate taxes. </p>
