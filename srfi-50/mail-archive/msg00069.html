<pre>I appologize for not having allready read much of the discussion index (or
having looked into things in too much detail).

though this seems generally interesting, the spec did strike me a little
more as defining a conceptual interpreter (or at least the glue between the
physical interpreter and some general conceptual code...). this may not
necisarrily be bad (or avoidable).
I can see a number of minor bits where something like this might pose
implementation chalanges in my case...

for my project (forsaking the possibility of interpreted use of this) I had
taken a different approach:
for general glue into c, I had been using autogenerated stubs;
the stubs had called the c functions in terms of the c type system (dynamic
types were also a usable type as well though), this had allowed gluing into
a much more general base of api (most of which does not know it was not
talking with plain c);
for calling back into my implementation I had imagined generating stubs that
convert to internal types and apply with a function (possibly working in
terms of a variable).

for a lot of other things I had made use of a different property, namely,
that I am comiling to c. I had added features for generating inline c and
also for adding dynamic forms and handling type conversions.
at present I have 3 forms of inline c:
'c-top', used for inline c belonging at the top of the c output (eg: with
header includes, function defines, ...);
'c-inline', goes in the currently being generated code;
'c-exp', a c expression that evaluates to a value.

I have thus far been able to largely write a basic gl wrapper in terms of
inline c and macros (had I used the ffi or actual wrapper code there would
have been a bit more work).

additionally, the c code sees very little evidence of the language &quot;just
over the border&quot;, thus in many cases the code is quite portable (though, in
others, the code depends on the workings of my implementation...).

a problem is that virtually none of this is actually useful for the
interpreted case though...

all for now.
