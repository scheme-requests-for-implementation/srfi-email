<pre>I think the goal of the document is a bit ambiguous.  Specifically,
I feel there are three issues intermixed; they are related each
other, but it'll be clearer to separate the discussion as much
as possible.

1. Defining unicode API: &quot;If a Scheme implementation supports
   API that explicitly deals with Unicode, it should be so and so&quot;.

   This goal tries to define a common API to interface the outer
   Unicode world, while allowing the implemenation to choose their
   internal representations.

2. Addressing unicode-specific issues: &quot;If a Scheme implementation
   uses Unicode as its native character representation, it should be
   so and so&quot;.

   Some issues raised in the document are based on the assumption
   that the implementation uses Unicode or iso-8859-* CCS (coded
   character set) in its native representation.

   If the document limit its scope to &quot;the implementations that uses
   Unicode/iso8859-* internally&quot;, it's fine.  Is that the intention
   of the document?

    * If the implementation uses EUCJP as its internal CES, it
      will face difficulty for the recommendation of INTEGER-&gt;CHAR
      to support [0,255], since EUCJP does not have full mappings
      in this range, although it has much more characters than 256.
      I think it's possible that (integer-&gt;char #xa1) on such
      implementations returns a &quot;pseudo character&quot;, which doesn't
      corresponds to any character in EUCJP CES but is guaranteed
      that to produce #xa1 when passed to char-&gt;integer.  But the
      effects would be undefined if such a character is used within
      a string.  (An implementation can also choose different
      integers than the codepoint value to fulfill this &quot;256 character&quot;
      requirements, but it wouldn't be intuitive).

    * &quot;What _is_ a Character&quot; section doesn't refer to an
      implementation where a CHAR? value corresponts to a
      codepoint of non-Unocde, non-iso8859-* CCS/CES.

    * In the portable FFI section, some APIs state the encoding
      must be one of utf-8, iso8859-* or ascii, and I don't see
      the reason of such restrictions.

3. Determining the least common set of assumptions about characters
   and strings the language/FFI spec should define.

   Mostly in &quot;R6RS recommendation&quot; section.  Some of them seem
   try to be codeset-independent, while some of them seem to
   assume Unicode/iso8859-* codeset implicitly.  So I wonder
   which is the intention of the document.


Another issue: is there a rationale about &quot;strong encouragement&quot;
of O(1) access of string-ref and string-set!?   There are
alrogithms that truly need random access, but in many cases,
index is used just to mark certain location of the string;
e.g. if you want (string-ref str 3), it's rare that you know
'3' is significant before you know about str---it's more likely
that somebody (string search function, regexp matcher, or suffix
database...) told you that the 3rd character of a particular
string in str is significant.  In such cases, the reason you
use index is not because the algorithm requires it, but just
one of the possible means to have a reference within a string.
I feel that accessing strings by index is a kind of premature
optimization, which came from the history when strings were
simply an array of bytes.    Some algorithms may still require
random access, but we already have a primitive datatype that
guarantee O(1) access---a vector.   I don't think we should
make a string just a vector with a restricted element type.
