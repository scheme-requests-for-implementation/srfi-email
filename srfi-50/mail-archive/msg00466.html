&gt;     &gt; It seems to me similar problems will occur working with any
&gt;     &gt; third-party tool that presumes it is sufficient to let people pass
&gt;     &gt; around pointers to data of their own definition.
&gt; 
&gt;     &gt; So, in the end, it looks to me as if Pika will need to provide a
&gt;     &gt; JNI-style interface anyway, in addition to the C compound-statement-
&gt;     &gt; bound interface, which would still be the preferred interface for C
&gt;     &gt; code written against Pika interfaces.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that has to be read as &quot;JNI-style&quot; in only the broadest sense
&gt; of the term -- a need for an interface to create locations whose
&gt; lifetime is explicitly managed.  Narrower &quot;JNI-style&quot; features that
&gt; are _not_ necessary include:
&gt; 
&gt; ~ reference counting for locations
&gt; ~ &quot;linear&quot; functions
&gt; ~ attachment of locations to a &quot;call&quot; structure whose lifetime
&gt;   trumps the reference count of attached locations

Where did reference counting come from?  I don't think I've ever
mentioned it.  The Minor interface doesn't include any, nor does the
actual JNI, as far as I know.  Is there some use case where simply
duplicating references won't work just as well?

The linear functions are just an attempt to make the &quot;explicit free&quot;
discipline less troublesome.  Distinguishing local and global
references, and associating the former with calls, is the same.  I
agree that they don't make it non-troublesome.

I see the idea of explicitly freed references with dynamic lifetimes
as the essential idea in the JNI model.

&gt; What about your parser example?  You exhibit code like this:
&gt; 
&gt;   /* The type of Bison semantic values.  */
&gt;   #define YYSTYPE mn_ref *
&gt; 
&gt;   [....]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   list: '(' list_data ')' { $$ = $2 };
&gt; 
&gt;   list_data:
&gt;       datum list_data { $$ = mn_to_cons (c, $1, $2); }
&gt;     | datum '.' datum { $$ = mn_to_cons (c, $1, $3); }
&gt;     |                 { $$ = mn_null (c); }
&gt;     ;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It's worth noting first that that's pretty fragile code in two ways:
&gt; 
&gt; First, actions such as the one in:
&gt; 
&gt;       datum list_data { $$ = mn_to_cons (c, $1, $2); }
&gt; 
&gt; are destructive of $1.   A simple modification to:
&gt; 
&gt;       datum list_data { 
&gt;                         $$ = mn_to_cons (c, $1, $2); 
&gt;                         log_obj_added_to_list (c, $1);
&gt;                       }
&gt; 
&gt; with the intention of logging the list element, not the new list spine
&gt; pair, is incorrect.

Right; the object is freed too early.  But all explicit-free models
have this problem.  Your interface will, too, won't it?  (You've
provided example code for this below, so that's probably the better
place to answer the question.)

&gt; Second, all intermediate values constructed in this parse but _not_
&gt; stored in a reference that will be destructively updated (such as $2
&gt; in the action above) are GC protected for the lifetime of the parse.
&gt; To have a parse that protected a number of locations bound by the 
&gt; depth of the value stack, one would need to write something like:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;       datum list_data { 
&gt;                         $$ = mn_to_cons (c, $1, $2); 
&gt;                         mn_unref (c, $2);
&gt;                       }
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, on two counts at least, the enticing simplicity 
&gt; of the exhibited code is at least a little bit misleading.

mn_to_cons is defined to free both its arguments.  Given that, there
shouldn't be any reference leak in the code as written, right?  (Not
that I expect you to rush off and check minor.h every time I post
code...)

(&quot;Linear&quot; isn't a great term for this any more: in the sense that
&quot;mn_to_car&quot; is linear, &quot;mn_to_cons&quot; is a Y-shaped thing.  Using &quot;to&quot;
as my linearity marker in function names isn't great either; one would
like to use it to mark type-conversion functions.  So I've got to
revise all that.)

I certainly may have missed something, but my intention wasn't to
mislead:

- As far as I know, the problems of linearity are shared by all
  explicit-free models.

- And as far as I know, the number of references used by the posted
  code is proportional to the depth of the parse stack by the end of
  each action.

So I think you are right to be enticed by that enticing simplicity.  :)


&gt; I suppose that the brute force Pika solution would look something
&gt; like:
&gt; 
&gt;       datum list_data { 
&gt;                         $$ = scm_allocate_location (instance);
&gt;                         scm_cons ($$, instance, $1, $2);
&gt;                         scm_location_unref (instance, $1);
&gt;                         scm_location_unref (instance, $2);
&gt;                       }
&gt; 
&gt; which, although four times as verbose as your original code (twice as
&gt; verbose as the more robust form of your code), is not fragile wrt to
&gt; &quot;linear&quot; operations and is accurate wrt to GC.

I can't refer to $1 and $2 after those *_unref calls, right?  The
purpose of the linear versions of functions like mn_cons is simply to
reduce clutter from the 'free' calls (while leaving them visible), and
to put them someplace they could be optimized.  But they're still
there; I think our code is essentially the same.
