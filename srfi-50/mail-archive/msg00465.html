    &gt; From: Jim Blandy &lt;jimb@xxxxxxxxxx&gt;

    &gt; I've come across a situation which is reasonably straightforward to
    &gt; handle in a JNI-style interface, but which I think requires machinery
    &gt; I haven't seen yet in Pika-style.  I'd like to see the Pika folks'
    &gt; solution here.

    &gt; When I write actions for a Bison grammar, it's pretty straightforward
    &gt; to use Minor references in the semantic actions.  [....]
    &gt; [...code...]

    &gt; The underlying issue here is that we want the generated parser's stack
    &gt; of semantic values to hold references to Scheme objects.  Since a
    &gt; JNI-style interface works on pointers to dynamically allocated
    &gt; references, one can simply declare semantic values to be such
    &gt; pointers, as we do with the #definition of YYSTYPE above.  We use
    &gt; &quot;linear&quot; functions like mn_to_cons to free intermediate references.
    &gt; If the parser exits with an error, any local references on the stack
    &gt; are freed properly when the mn_call returns.

    &gt; It seems to me that handling this in Pika requires one to use a
    &gt; separate facility that hasn't been described on this list before,
    &gt; which allows Pika references to appear inside other data
    &gt; structures,

That's right.  This is a specific instance of the general need for a
facility to create locations in C whose lifetime exceeds the dynamic
extent of the block of code that creates them.

I mentioned that omission back when I first described the Pika
conventions on this list.

    &gt; It seems to me similar problems will occur working with any
    &gt; third-party tool that presumes it is sufficient to let people pass
    &gt; around pointers to data of their own definition.

    &gt; So, in the end, it looks to me as if Pika will need to provide a
    &gt; JNI-style interface anyway, in addition to the C compound-statement-
    &gt; bound interface, which would still be the preferred interface for C
    &gt; code written against Pika interfaces.

I think that has to be read as &quot;JNI-style&quot; in only the broadest sense
of the term -- a need for an interface to create locations whose
lifetime is explicitly managed.  Narrower &quot;JNI-style&quot; features that
are _not_ necessary include:

~ reference counting for locations
~ &quot;linear&quot; functions
~ attachment of locations to a &quot;call&quot; structure whose lifetime
  trumps the reference count of attached locations

My personal opinion is that simple reference counting of explicitly
managed locations may, in fact, be desirable -- but it isn't strictly
necessary.  Separate linear functions aren't needed at all nor is the
&quot;call&quot; structure approach to location lifetime mgt.

A strawman of what such an interface in Pika might look like would be:

	t_scm_word * scm_allocate_location (t_scm_arena arena);
           Allocate a new location with a reference count of 1.

	scm_location_ref (t_scm_arena arena, t_scm_word * loc);
	scm_location_unref (t_scm_arena arena, t_scm_word * loc);

What about your parser example?  You exhibit code like this:

  /* The type of Bison semantic values.  */
  #define YYSTYPE mn_ref *

  [....]


  list: '(' list_data ')' { $$ = $2 };

  list_data:
      datum list_data { $$ = mn_to_cons (c, $1, $2); }
    | datum '.' datum { $$ = mn_to_cons (c, $1, $3); }
    |                 { $$ = mn_null (c); }
    ;


It's worth noting first that that's pretty fragile code in two ways:

First, actions such as the one in:

      datum list_data { $$ = mn_to_cons (c, $1, $2); }

are destructive of $1.   A simple modification to:

      datum list_data { 
                        $$ = mn_to_cons (c, $1, $2); 
                        log_obj_added_to_list (c, $1);
                      }

with the intention of logging the list element, not the new list spine
pair, is incorrect.  The use of &quot;linear&quot; operations here is a by-hand
optimization -- but one that has a price in terms of code simplicity.
I think that this is a general weakness of explicit linear updates --
in examples where the linear update is further (textually) separated
from the errant subsequent use, and in situations where whether or not
a linear update has taken place depends on the control path through
the code, it can become quite an exercise to figure out which value a
C variable actually refers to.  It seems to me to be a programming
practice that raises the question of why we bother having compilers
that work hard at register assignment.

Second, all intermediate values constructed in this parse but _not_
stored in a reference that will be destructively updated (such as $2
in the action above) are GC protected for the lifetime of the parse.
To have a parse that protected a number of locations bound by the 
depth of the value stack, one would need to write something like:


      datum list_data { 
                        $$ = mn_to_cons (c, $1, $2); 
                        mn_unref (c, $2);
                      }

In other words, on two counts at least, the enticing simplicity 
of the exhibited code is at least a little bit misleading.

I suppose that the brute force Pika solution would look something
like:

      datum list_data { 
                        $$ = scm_allocate_location (instance);
                        scm_cons ($$, instance, $1, $2);
                        scm_location_unref (instance, $1);
                        scm_location_unref (instance, $2);
                      }

which, although four times as verbose as your original code (twice as
verbose as the more robust form of your code), is not fragile wrt to
&quot;linear&quot; operations and is accurate wrt to GC.

If you really wanted the linear optimization, you'd instead get:

      datum list_data { 
                        $$ = $1;
                        scm_cons ($$, instance, $1, $2);
                        scm_location_unref (instance, $2);
                      }

Either way, you wind up with code that looks about the same as what
you would get writing a (non-Scheme) traditional parser producing
reference-counted tree structures.

(There may also be more elegant solutions to the specific problem of
writing a parser using Bison -- I haven't thought about it.)
