By Googling, I happened to see #scheme IRC, and all schemers benefit the
internet community.

1. The following are excerpts relating to &quot;SOMEWHAT SLOW UNDER SOME
   CIRCUMSTANCES&quot; in Rationale of SRFI-86.
		
2006-04-05

09:36:19 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Wow, Soo's benchmarks demonstrating the relative efficiency of MU/NU and CWV/VALUES are so completely bogus I'm not sure whether to be amused or not.
09:38:14 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (And, yow, this is very, very slow.  Ten per cent packet loss for eleven hops to the machine where my IRC client is.)

2006-04-06

19:37:03 * Riastradh writes up a mail to the SRFI 86 list completely discrediting JCS's `benchmarks.'
19:37:07 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (even moreso than Clinger)
19:37:10 &lt;astecp&gt; minion: more sarahbot
19:37:11 &lt;minion&gt; sarahbot me harder
19:37:36 * astecp finds JCS's thinking on that list impenetrable

20:23:50 &lt;Riastradh&gt; T is a wee bit faster than Scheme48.
20:24:38 &lt;Riastradh&gt; What ten times takes ten seconds in T, takes one hundred fifty seconds in Scheme48 0.57.
20:24:46 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (on a 333 MHz UltraSPARC)
20:25:53 &lt;levi&gt; Nice.
20:26:12 &lt;Riastradh&gt; ...only one time in Scheme48, I forgot to add.
20:26:27 &lt;levi&gt; So, you just need to get it ported now. :)
20:26:53 --- join: somegeek (i=levin@unaffiliated/somegeek) joined #scheme
20:27:41 --- join: lilo (i=levin@freenode/staff/pdpc.levin) joined #scheme
20:29:14 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Or use Gauche...
20:29:22 &lt;Riastradh&gt; ?
20:29:29 --- quit: sarahbot (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
20:34:08 &lt;levi&gt; Riastradh: Obviously, you'll get no respect for T unless you benchmark it against Gauche, Gambit, Chicken, etc... ;)
20:34:21 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I'm going to run Gambit, too.
20:34:28 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Chicken doesn't count because it doesn't optimize CWV at all.
20:34:44 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I'm hoping Gambit does, but I'm too lazy to delve into Feeley's awful code to find out.
20:34:57 --- quit: Khisanth (&quot;Leaving&quot;)
20:35:10 --- join: Khisanth (n=Khisanth@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx) joined #scheme
20:35:22 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Oops.
20:35:25 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Nope, Gambit doesn't, argh.
20:35:47 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Hmmmm.
20:35:53 * Riastradh pokes about for another Scheme that does.
20:35:59 &lt;levi&gt; CWV?
20:36:05 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (Gauche has a primitive compiler in which RECEIVE performs differently from CWV.  Bletch.)
20:36:09 &lt;Riastradh&gt; CALL-WITH-VALUES
20:36:56 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Ah, RScheme does.
20:37:03 &lt;Riastradh&gt; ...uh...now how do I run RScheme's compiler?
20:38:16 --- quit: somegeek_ (Connection timed out)
20:39:09 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Anyone happen to have a machine with Chez on it which I could use briefly?  (Full Chez, not Petite.)
20:41:55 --- join: yome (n=ber@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx) joined #scheme
20:42:03 &lt;yome&gt; minion, chant!
20:42:03 &lt;minion&gt; MORE THAN
20:42:17 --- quit: arcus (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
20:42:31 --- quit: easy4 (Remote closed the connection)
20:43:51 --- join: easy4 (n=ez4@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx) joined #scheme
20:47:41 &lt;Riastradh&gt; foof: ping
20:48:58 &lt;foof&gt; pong
20:49:20 &lt;Riastradh&gt; foof, does Gauche implement multiple return values in any better way than just wrapping them in a list with a special tag?
20:49:47 &lt;foof&gt; yes, it puts them directly on the stack
20:49:51 &lt;Riastradh&gt; OK, good.
20:50:30 &lt;Riastradh&gt; There are remarkably few Scheme systems that have effective implementations of it, I am sorry to say.  The only ones I can find are T, Scheme48, Chez, and Gauche.
20:53:01 &lt;Riastradh&gt; ...oh, and RScheme.
20:53:18 * Riastradh builds Gauche on that machine.
20:54:23 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Pfhoo.  rscheme.org is down.
20:55:37 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (Gambit, Chicken, MIT Scheme, Larceny, SXM (don't ask), Chez, and MzScheme have stupid representations of multiple values.)
20:57:27 &lt;foof&gt; and Stalin has none
20:59:14 --- quit: drewr (Connection timed out)
20:59:51 * yome asks.
20:59:57 &lt;Riastradh&gt; ?
21:00:05 &lt;yome&gt; SXM?
21:00:25 &lt;jonphilpott&gt; i saw ex-president gorbachov(sp?) today
21:00:35 &lt;jonphilpott&gt; (Stalin reminded me of the event)
21:00:37 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Some totally random Scheme implementation written by some totally random Schemer which has absolutely no qualities to recommend itself and which I happen to have installed on this machine.
21:00:59 &lt;Riastradh&gt; jonphilpott, don't worry about the Latinized spelling; it's properly spelt with Cyrillic anyway.
21:01:15 &lt;jonphilpott&gt; ah
21:01:18 &lt;yome&gt; &#xC3;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xC2;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xC3;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xC2;&#xBE;&#xC3;&#x91;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x80;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x90;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xB1;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x90;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xB0;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x91;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x87;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x91;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x91;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x90;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xB2;
21:01:23 &lt;jonphilpott&gt; i was dropping my dad off at LAX, and he was there
21:01:52 --- nick: gowlin -&gt; cowkiller
21:02:07 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Uh, wow, that crashed and burned.
21:02:40 &lt;yome&gt; <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.malgil.com/sxm/">http://www.malgil.com/sxm/</a>
21:03:05 &lt;Riastradh&gt; foof:

21:03:23 &lt;yome&gt; &quot;supports all features of the R5RS Report on Scheme&quot; &lt;-- Does it have TRANSCRIPT-ON and TRANSCRIPT-OFF ?
21:04:00 &lt;Riastradh&gt; In fact, it does.
21:04:06 &lt;yome&gt; Nice.
21:04:47 &lt;foof&gt; hmmm
21:05:00 &lt;Riastradh&gt; It, T, and MIT Scheme are the only ones I know of that support it.
21:05:01 &lt;yome&gt; btw, ~4 SRFIs should hit srfi.schemers.org soon, written by Feeley.
21:05:11 --- nick: cowkiller -&gt; gowlin
21:05:11 &lt;foof&gt; ooh, cyrillic
21:05:31 --- quit: Khisanth (&quot;Leaving&quot;)

21:06:15 &lt;foof&gt; Riastradh: 64-bit machine?
21:06:16 &lt;joshcryer&gt; yome, what implementation is that?
21:06:24 &lt;Riastradh&gt; foof, yeah.
21:06:41 &lt;foof&gt; OK, I've built Gauche on sparcs, but not ultra-sparcs
21:06:45 &lt;yome&gt; joshcryer, the one Riastradh mentioned.
21:07:06 &lt;joshcryer&gt; SXM?
21:07:08 &lt;foof&gt; It works on other 64-bit platforms though, so shouldn't be hard to get compiled.
21:07:12 &lt;Riastradh&gt; foof, any SPARC-9 is 64-bit.
21:07:24 &lt;joshcryer&gt; n/m, went to the site and got a confirmation. :)
21:08:r46 &lt;joshcryer&gt; What do you mean by stupid representations of multiple values Riastradh?
21:08:48 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Anyone here know how to use RScheme?
21:09:01 --- join: sarahbot (n=siscbot@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx) joined #scheme

21:09:32 --- quit: easy4 (Remote closed the connection)
21:09:34 * joshcryer head begins to swell up
21:09:56 &lt;yome&gt; Riastradh, bah, I simply use SRFI-86.
21:09:58 &lt;foof&gt; Riastradh: I'm using a Sun Blade 100, 32-bit
21:10:07 --- part: decaf left #scheme
21:10:09 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Riastradh, so those implemenations would give an incorrect result?
21:10:14 &lt;Riastradh&gt; joshcryer, no.
21:10:19 &lt;jonphilpott&gt; i wanted to get a picture with him, but i feared if the feds saw it, i'd never get my residency
21:10:19 &lt;Riastradh&gt; That's a correct implementation of multiple return values.
21:10:43 &lt;Riastradh&gt; jonphilpott, hey, he's more popular in the West than in the Soviet Union!
21:10:50 &lt;jonphilpott&gt; hehe
21:11:01 &lt;jonphilpott&gt; maybe he could have sponsored me
21:11:37 &lt;jonphilpott&gt; reminds me of the begining of naked gun, when he says &quot;I have the Americans thinking I'm a nice guy&quot;
21:11:53 --- quit: lilo (Nick collision from services.)
21:11:54 &lt;Riastradh&gt; ...heh, I was just about to mention that.
21:12:09 &lt;gnomon&gt; .
21:12:11 &lt;joshcryer&gt; jonphilpott, I think you totally dated yourself.
21:12:51 --- join: lilo (i=levin@freenode/staff/pdpc.levin) joined #scheme
21:12:55 &lt;jonphilpott&gt; i haven't seen that movie in a long time
21:12:58 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Oh wait, hahaha, I thought you saw freaking STALIN at LAX.
21:13:02 &lt;joshcryer&gt; What is wrong with me. God.
21:13:04 &lt;jonphilpott&gt; haha
21:13:09 &lt;jonphilpott&gt; that would have been neat
21:13:58 &lt;joshcryer&gt; That's what happens when I try to understand Riastradh's code (which btw, he probably typed in IRC in real time).
21:14:33 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I did.
21:14:38 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Freak~!
21:15:18 --- join: somegeek_ (i=levin@unaffiliated/somegeek) joined #scheme
21:16:26 &lt;joshcryer&gt; (that was a joke, for the record, I mean nothing but good intentions to the geniuses that inhabit this channel)
21:16:52 * Riastradh builds Gauche and RScheme with -m32 for the sake of expedience.
21:17:07 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (In fairness, T and Scheme48 are running as 32-bit programs too.)

22:33:36 * Riastradh sends off his debunkery of the performance arguments on the SRFI 86 list.

22:35:44 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (SRFI 86 is funny.)
22:37:00 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Oh, is it a new April fools SRFI?
22:37:13 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I don't think that was the intent, but it is a pretty good extended April fools' joke.
22:37:22 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Just take a look at some of the `benchmarks' Soo proposes.
22:37:46 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (time (for-each (lambda (x) (m list)) (make-list 100000 1)))    ; This is supposed to test the performance of M -- not FOR-EACH, not MAKE-LIST.
22:37:57 &lt;joshcryer&gt; (internet is crapping out on me right now which is why I asked rather than looked)
22:38:09 &lt;foof&gt; Riastradh: CWV in Gauche assumes the general case of a function call, and doesn't check to see if the receiver is a lambda (Gauche is still pre 1.0 and has a very simple compiler).
22:39:44 &lt;Riastradh&gt; foof, yeah, that's what I suspected.
22:40:07 &lt;Riastradh&gt; But I never let slip opportunities for disparaging remarks like that about the quality of compilers!
22:40:16 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Haha
22:40:30 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Gauche is still faster than S48, and performance is all that matters!!!
22:41:10 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Slower for MU.
22:41:49 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I surprised myself by trying to maintain politeness and levity in the last paragraph.  I narrowly avoided a stinging characterization of the previous benchmarks.
22:42:20 &lt;joshcryer&gt; I have no idea what is even going on, so it's okay.
22:42:31 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Soo posted some totally bogus benchmarks.
22:42:41 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Oh, Soo is a person?
22:42:42 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Clinger showed how to reinterpret them to lift the bogosity.
22:42:43 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Haha
22:42:47 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Well, maybe.
22:43:02 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I then posted some replacement benchmarks that are, of course, vastly superior and more accurate to the truth.
22:43:04 &lt;foof&gt; What Scheme does Soo use?
22:43:11 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Where did he post them? c.l.s?
22:43:13 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (cough cough benchmarks cough cough hiccup hiccup burp vomit)
22:43:16 &lt;Riastradh&gt; The SRFI 86 mailing list.
22:43:25 &lt;Riastradh&gt; foof, he tried Scheme48, MzScheme, Chicken, MIT Scheme, &amp; Petite Chez.
22:43:45 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Oh. I see now. (Internet is working again.) Sorry. Heh
22:43:49 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I do not know, though, whether he ran the code interpreted or compiled in Chicken and MIT Scheme.
22:43:52 --- quit: jonphilpott (Remote closed the connection)
22:44:06 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Nor do I know whether he allowed integration of primitives in Scheme48.
22:44:21 &lt;foof&gt; No, I mean in general, his preferred implementation.
22:44:28 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Oh.  Scheme48, I think.
22:44:34 &lt;Riastradh&gt; But I'm only guessing.
22:44:41 &lt;Riastradh&gt; My other guess would be MzScheme.
22:45:39 &lt;elibarzilay&gt; 1:32 into the call.  We're done with the ceremonial search for the &quot;Start&quot; button, with making sure that the connected computer is rally connected, and we're done reading menu entries, and whole dialogs.  I have managed to convince the service-bot that the router is faulty.  I get the honor of replacing it.  Of course that requires creating a new record for the replacement operation, and that requires that he re-type everything again.
22:46:03 &lt;foof&gt; OK, who's going to post the benchmarks showing CPS to be faster than anything else?
22:46:07 &lt;joshcryer&gt; elibarzilay, holy crap man.
22:46:16 &lt;Riastradh&gt; foof, SRFI 86 *is* CPS.
22:46:19 &lt;joshcryer&gt; foof, who's going to write the code?
22:46:36 &lt;joshcryer&gt; SRFI 86 looks like it was created by a machine.
22:46:44 &lt;elibarzilay&gt; It took 1.5 minutes to go over the spelling of &quot;M-a-s-s-a-c-h-u-s-e-t-t-s&quot;
22:46:46 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (or rather, SRFI 86's MU)
22:46:59 &lt;Riastradh&gt; And I just showed that using multiple values runs faster by a factor of nearly three.
22:47:17 &lt;Riastradh&gt; No, a factor of about three; in one case, less, and in another, more.
22:47:37 &lt;joshcryer&gt; elibarzilay, I really fucking hate (sorry for the language) when they make you go through a billion steps that you've already done before calling them.
22:48:10 &lt;foof&gt;  MU generates an intermediate closure and uses apply.
22:49:44 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Nope.
22:50:09 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Well, it generates an intermediate closure, but it doesn't use APPLY, and the usage of CPS procedures requires intermediate closures anyway.
22:50:30 &lt;foof&gt; (or rather, NU uses APPLY)
22:50:36 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Right.  NU doesn't matter.
22:51:11 --- quit: jewel (Remote closed the connection)
22:51:17 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Anyway, I said I wanted to sleep tonight in the email, so I'm going off to bed.
22:51:23 &lt;gnomon&gt; elibarzilay, that's totally unacceptable. Have you been escalated to his/her supervisor yet?
22:51:27 &lt;gnomon&gt; Sleep well, Riastradh .
22:51:32 &lt;joshcryer&gt; 'night Riastradh
22:54:29 &lt;joshcryer&gt; To be fair to this Soo's guy, whatever he's doing seems to help optimize implementations that... aren't optimized.
22:55:07 * gnomon mumbles something about premature optimization
22:55:38 &lt;vegai&gt; premature optimization is evil =&gt; efficient code is evil
22:55:40 * vegai hides.


2. The following are all the excerpts relating SRFI-86.

2006-04-04

13:49:52 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Oh, NO...another `Joo ChurlSoo' SRFI...
13:50:31 &lt;michaelw&gt; Riastradh: do you know about thinlisp?
13:50:36 &lt;Riastradh&gt; No?

13:53:15 &lt;yome&gt; Why do people bother submitting SRFIs like this?
13:53:22 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I don't get it, yome.
13:54:06 &lt;yome&gt; It's better to simply do a crappy post on c.l.s about it then polluting the SRFI process.

00:54:04 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Apparently the fact that Scheme48 evaluated arguments in an order contrary to what he expected means that Scheme48 is buggy and has a `lambda inconsistency.'
00:54:25 &lt;forcer&gt; Riastradh: Have you seen the third email on the SRFI-86 list?

00:55:03 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I expect a diatribe of irrelevant randomness and some really, really painful code examples from Soo.

00:56:02 &lt;forcer&gt; ;-)
00:56:13 &lt;forcer&gt; He should have called it xilet.
00:56:18 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I don't think I have seen a more complex macro than %ALET since I fiddled with syntax-lib.
00:56:20 &lt;gnomon&gt; &quot;*A*nyone seen my LET? I know I left it around here somewhere...&quot;
00:56:23 &lt;foof&gt; xahlet?
00:56:26 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (which was basically SRFI 53)
00:56:55 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Oh, actually, I guess 57 had some pretty hairably horrible macrology too.
00:57:45 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (But then that contained half of syntax-lib/SRFI 53 anyway, and it was more readable than %ALET, too.)
00:57:51 &lt;foof&gt; Well, he included a full pattern matcher...
00:57:59 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Who, Soo or Tonder?

01:08:02 &lt;yome&gt; forcer, yeah, &quot;idiot&quot; is probably too harsh.  But I'm a bit pissed about irrelevant SRFIs polluting what could be a useful process.

09:36:19 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Wow, Soo's benchmarks demonstrating the relative efficiency of MU/NU and CWV/VALUES are so completely bogus I'm not sure whether to be amused or not.
09:38:14 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (And, yow, this is very, very slow.  Ten per cent packet loss for eleven hops to the machine where my IRC client is.)

20:49:47 &lt;foof&gt; yes, it puts them directly on the stack
20:49:51 &lt;Riastradh&gt; OK, good.

21:16:52 * Riastradh builds Gauche and RScheme with -m32 for the sake of expedience.
21:17:07 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (In fairness, T and Scheme48 are running as 32-bit programs too.)

22:33:36 * Riastradh sends off his debunkery of the performance arguments on the SRFI 86 list.

22:35:44 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (SRFI 86 is funny.)
22:37:00 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Oh, is it a new April fools SRFI?
22:37:13 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I don't think that was the intent, but it is a pretty good extended April fools' joke.
22:37:22 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Just take a look at some of the `benchmarks' Soo proposes.
22:37:46 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (time (for-each (lambda (x) (m list)) (make-list 100000 1)))    ; This is supposed to test the performance of M -- not FOR-EACH, not MAKE-LIST.
22:37:57 &lt;joshcryer&gt; (internet is crapping out on me right now which is why I asked rather than looked)
22:38:09 &lt;foof&gt; Riastradh: CWV in Gauche assumes the general case of a function call, and doesn't check to see if the receiver is a lambda (Gauche is still pre 1.0 and has a very simple compiler).
22:39:44 &lt;Riastradh&gt; foof, yeah, that's what I suspected.
22:40:07 &lt;Riastradh&gt; But I never let slip opportunities for disparaging remarks like that about the quality of compilers!
22:40:16 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Haha
22:40:30 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Gauche is still faster than S48, and performance is all that matters!!!
22:41:10 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Slower for MU.
22:41:49 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I surprised myself by trying to maintain politeness and levity in the last paragraph.  I narrowly avoided a stinging characterization of the previous benchmarks.
22:42:20 &lt;joshcryer&gt; I have no idea what is even going on, so it's okay.
22:42:31 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Soo posted some totally bogus benchmarks.
22:42:41 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Oh, Soo is a person?
22:42:42 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Clinger showed how to reinterpret them to lift the bogosity.
22:42:43 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Haha
22:42:47 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Well, maybe.
22:43:02 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I then posted some replacement benchmarks that are, of course, vastly superior and more accurate to the truth.
22:43:04 &lt;foof&gt; What Scheme does Soo use?
22:43:11 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Where did he post them? c.l.s?

22:43:45 &lt;joshcryer&gt; Oh. I see now. (Internet is working again.) Sorry. Heh
22:43:49 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I do not know, though, whether he ran the code interpreted or compiled in Chicken and MIT Scheme.
22:43:52 --- quit: jonphilpott (Remote closed the connection)
22:44:06 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Nor do I know whether he allowed integration of primitives in Scheme48.
22:44:21 &lt;foof&gt; No, I mean in general, his preferred implementation.
22:44:28 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Oh.  Scheme48, I think.
22:44:34 &lt;Riastradh&gt; But I'm only guessing.
22:44:41 &lt;Riastradh&gt; My other guess would be MzScheme.
22:45:39 &lt;elibarzilay&gt; 1:32 into the call.  We're done with the ceremonial search for the &quot;Start&quot; button, with making sure that the connected computer is rally connected, and we're done reading menu entries, and whole dialogs.  I have managed to convince the service-bot that the router is faulty.  I get the honor of replacing it.  Of course that requires creating a new record for the replacement operation, and that requires that he re-type everything again.
22:46:03 &lt;foof&gt; OK, who's going to post the benchmarks showing CPS to be faster than anything else?
22:46:07 &lt;joshcryer&gt; elibarzilay, holy crap man.
22:46:16 &lt;Riastradh&gt; foof, SRFI 86 *is* CPS.
22:46:19 &lt;joshcryer&gt; foof, who's going to write the code?
22:46:36 &lt;joshcryer&gt; SRFI 86 looks like it was created by a machine.
22:46:44 &lt;elibarzilay&gt; It took 1.5 minutes to go over the spelling of &quot;M-a-s-s-a-c-h-u-s-e-t-t-s&quot;
22:46:46 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (or rather, SRFI 86's MU)
22:46:59 &lt;Riastradh&gt; And I just showed that using multiple values runs faster by a factor of nearly three.
22:47:17 &lt;Riastradh&gt; No, a factor of about three; in one case, less, and in another, more.
22:47:37 &lt;joshcryer&gt; elibarzilay, I really fucking hate (sorry for the language) when they make you go through a billion steps that you've already done before calling them.
22:48:10 &lt;foof&gt;  MU generates an intermediate closure and uses apply.
22:49:44 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Nope.
22:50:09 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Well, it generates an intermediate closure, but it doesn't use APPLY, and the usage of CPS procedures requires intermediate closures anyway.
22:50:30 &lt;foof&gt; (or rather, NU uses APPLY)
22:50:36 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Right.  NU doesn't matter.
22:51:11 --- quit: jewel (Remote closed the connection)
22:51:17 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Anyway, I said I wanted to sleep tonight in the email, so I'm going off to bed.
22:51:23 &lt;gnomon&gt; elibarzilay, that's totally unacceptable. Have you been escalated to his/her supervisor yet?
22:51:27 &lt;gnomon&gt; Sleep well, Riastradh .
22:51:32 &lt;joshcryer&gt; 'night Riastradh
22:54:29 &lt;joshcryer&gt; To be fair to this Soo's guy, whatever he's doing seems to help optimize implementations that... aren't optimized.
22:55:07 * gnomon mumbles something about premature optimization
22:55:38 &lt;vegai&gt; premature optimization is evil =&gt; efficient code is evil
22:55:40 * vegai hides.

14:39:44 &lt;forcer&gt; What exactly didn't Mr. Soo get about Riastradh's (paraphrased) &quot;all benchmarks lie&quot;?
14:40:22 --- quit: gonz (&quot;Acumulando stress 24/7&quot;)
14:42:15 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I haven't the foggiest idea.
14:44:55 &lt;acon&gt; Why bother with srfi-86? For entertainment?
14:45:47 &lt;Riastradh&gt; At the moment, yes, it is very entertaining.
14:47:09 &lt;acon&gt; I haven't actually read the srfi. The shape of it was to scary for my fragile little mind.
14:47:38 &lt;forcer&gt; I actually do think that MU and NU are useful idioms. I just don't think that they're useful idioms for multiple values.
14:48:49 &lt;forcer&gt; I also think the names suck big time.
14:48:51 &lt;forcer&gt; ;-)
14:49:52 &lt;yome&gt; Riastradh, not available :(
14:51:25 &lt;yome&gt; &quot;As I don't think that the &lt;some unspecified order&gt; of LET means a pure random order that is neither sequential from left to right nor sequential from right to left, I wonder what the rationale for &lt;unspecified order&gt; evaluation of LET is.&quot;
14:51:26 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Hm?

14:54:13 &lt;r2q2&gt; forcer: They are also implemented in another srfi as cut.
14:54:56 --- quit: bpt (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
14:54:56 &lt;yome&gt; r2q2, what's &quot;They&quot; ?
14:55:03 &lt;r2q2&gt; forcer: And cut apply.
14:55:08 &lt;r2q2&gt; yome: mu and nu.
14:55:21 &lt;forcer&gt; r2q2: I have read mmmdonuts's posting as well, yes.
14:55:50 &lt;forcer&gt; r2q2: In the same way, you can argue that CUT is already implemented as LAMBDA.
14:56:10 &lt;r2q2&gt; Heh.
14:56:19 &lt;yome&gt; forcer, it's jensa's post.
14:56:26 &lt;forcer&gt; yome: Really?
14:56:27 &lt;forcer&gt; Oops.

2006-04-08

06:27:19 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Wow, Soo is totally missing the point.

06:47:09 &lt;Riastradh&gt; CAR is sometimes faster than CDR!
06:47:25 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (depending on circumstances and/or your Scheme implementation)
06:48:15 &lt;forcer&gt; :-)
06:49:56 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I hope he gets the point this time.
06:50:11 &lt;forcer&gt; Hehe
06:50:15 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (not that I *expect* him to)
06:52:35 --- quit: easy4 ()
06:54:56 --- quit: HET2 (&quot;This computer has gone to sleep&quot;)
07:07:28 &lt;gnomon&gt; Riastradh, I've often heard you complain about Soo's nonsense, but I haven't really known why until I read over the SRFI-86 commentary.
07:08:48 &lt;forcer&gt; His formatting SRFI had been there for a long time.
07:09:13 &lt;Riastradh&gt; And his `handling rest list' SRFI.
07:09:36 &lt;Riastradh&gt; There is a certain magnificence to his SRFIs.
07:09:39 &lt;gnomon&gt; Which were those?
07:09:42 &lt;gnomon&gt; Wait, never mind.
07:09:58 &lt;gnomon&gt; I'll look 'em up myself. No sense troubling you[p].
07:11:17 &lt;forcer&gt; SRFI 54 :-)
07:16:47 &lt;Riastradh&gt; It's a similar sort of magnificence to that which pervades the world of SYNTAX-CASE.
07:17:35 &lt;bitwize&gt; you mean the magnificence of excessive unnecessary cruft?

07:59:14 * Riastradh explodes violently.
07:59:27 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Soo + Schlie &lt;-&gt; matter + antimatter
08:00:29 &lt;bitwize&gt; kuh!!!!

08:03:52 &lt;arcus&gt; Schlie is always nigh-incomprehensible
08:04:09 &lt;Riastradh&gt; There is one reassuring thought.
08:04:23 &lt;Riastradh&gt; No implementor in his right mind would listen to these madmen.
08:04:47 &lt;arcus&gt; that doesn't _exactly_ say that no implementor _will_ listen to these madmen...

07:11:18 * Riastradh boggles at Soo's latest response.
07:11:41 &lt;astecp&gt; you weren't already boggled?
07:11:52 &lt;Riastradh&gt; It's a slope of increasing bogglement.
07:12:00 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Actually, it may be a curve.
07:12:31 &lt;foof&gt; Exponential?
07:13:21 --- join: vimalk (n=vimal@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx) joined #scheme
07:13:26 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Soo certainly is an amazing fellow in this regard.
07:14:59 * astecp starts to wonder if there's a school somewhere giving extra credit on an introductory scheme class for submitting an srfi
07:18:32 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Just to be sure, may I ask whether I seem to be making sense in my emails?
07:27:04 &lt;foof&gt; You seem to be saying that if one is to discuss the theoretical performance of MV, it only really makes sense to consider systems that have actually implemented it efficiently.  I have no idea what Soo is trying to say.
07:28:03 &lt;petekaz&gt; What mailing list is this?
07:28:21 &lt;Riastradh&gt; The SRFI 86 mailing list.
07:28:31 &lt;petekaz&gt; Thanks.
07:28:37 &lt;Riastradh&gt; foof, well, my overarching point is that performance is not worthwhile to discuss in the rationale.
07:28:51 --- join: serhei (n=user@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx) joined #scheme
07:29:14 &lt;foof&gt; Oh, I wasn't getting that... and I would have to disagree :)
07:29:36 &lt;Riastradh&gt; foof, or rather, it's not worthwhile for *Soo* to discuss.
07:30:49 &lt;Riastradh&gt; If this were a reasonable discussion, I should certainly argue that CWV is more potentially performant than MU, because it need not hit the GC; the lambdas that are its operands need only dynamic-extent closures, not arbitrary-extent closures.
07:33:36 --- quit: mifunez (&quot;Disconnected by the government&quot;)
07:34:17 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Even ignoring the performance of Scheme, this is particularly important in, say, Pre-Scheme, where arbitrary-extent closures *cannot* exist.
07:34:29 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (or a hypothetical extension to C for multiple return values)
07:34:55 &lt;foof&gt; Scheme should not in any way be constrained by what is possible or convenient in Pre-Scheme.
07:35:05 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I didn't say that.
07:35:22 &lt;foof&gt; ... or other underlying implementation.
07:36:16 &lt;Riastradh&gt; My words are extremely precise; I apologize if I seemed to indicate a relation between those two messages beyond a common theme of multiple return values.

08:03:24 &lt;foof&gt; Actually, apart from the names and the hideous syntax of ALET, I kind of like the general idea of SRFI-86.
08:03:40 &lt;Riastradh&gt; You mean, you like MU &amp; NU?
08:04:19 &lt;foof&gt; Yes (though not the names).
08:04:47 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I agree that the idiom can be useful, although I'm not sure why we need a SRFI for (LAMBDA (F) (F x y z)).
08:04:50 --- join: sludge_factory (n=sjr@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx) joined #scheme
08:05:45 &lt;foof&gt; We don't.  We need the SRFI for the ALET syntax, but not as it is.
08:12:22 &lt;foof&gt; Hmmm... direct CPS is slightly faster in Chicken though.
08:12:46 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I explained part of why that is the case on the SRFI 86 mailing list.
08:13:02 &lt;foof&gt; Why direct CPS is faster than MU?
08:13:19 &lt;Riastradh&gt; ...sorry, no, why MU is faster than multiple values.
08:13:28 &lt;Riastradh&gt; What exactly do you mean by `direct CPS?'
08:13:45 --- quit: Bobstopper (Read error: 113 (No route to host))
08:13:50 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (lambda (x y z k) ... (k ...) ...) instead of (lambda (x y z) ... (lambda (k) (k ...)) ...)?
08:14:13 &lt;foof&gt; Take a standard MV producer (one that calls VALUES).  Add VALUES as the first (or last) parameter.
08:14:34 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Sorry?
08:15:32 &lt;foof&gt; (define (mv-quotient&amp;remainder n d) (values (quotient n d) (remainder n d)))
08:15:41 &lt;foof&gt; (define (cps-quotient&amp;remainder values n d) (values (quotient n d) (remainder n d)))
08:15:52 &lt;foof&gt; Note the body stays entirely the same.
08:15:52 &lt;Riastradh&gt; OK.
08:16:14 &lt;Riastradh&gt; The reason that runs faster than MU is probably just that it involves one fewer closure allocation than the equivalent MU code would.
08:16:33 &lt;foof&gt; ... but extra parameter passing (it's slower in Gauche).
08:17:04 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I can't imagine that tacking on one more parameter would significantly hurt performance of this.
08:17:16 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (and Gauche is a slow interpreter anyway, so what does that matter!)
08:17:17 * Riastradh ducks.
08:17:49 &lt;foof&gt; Well, as interpreters go Gauche is pretty fast.  On the other hand, benchmarking interpreters is fairly meaningless.
08:18:13 --- join: Nshag (i=user@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx) joined #scheme
08:19:04 &lt;foof&gt; Oh, nevermind, bug in my benchmark.  Gauche does the CPS faster.
08:19:53 * foof debates adding this to the benchmark hall of horrors on the SRFI-86 list.
08:20:16 &lt;Riastradh&gt; I'd be surprised if Gauche did MU faster, since it involves more closure allocation, and allocation in Gauche is very expensive compared to systems with stop &amp; copy GCs like Chicken.
08:20:41 &lt;Riastradh&gt; (unless Gauche moved away from a non-moving, conservative GC since the last time I looked)
08:21:05 &lt;foof&gt; Nope, Boehm.
08:21:21 &lt;foof&gt; ... and likely to remain so as Gauche emphasizes C friendliness.
08:21:22 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Right, that's what I remembered.
08:22:01 * isomer` wonders why people don't build semi-space collectors, or even generational copying collectors
08:22:08 &lt;Riastradh&gt; C-friendliness bugs me.  C ought to be friendly to Lisp, not vice versa!
08:22:11 &lt;Riastradh&gt; isomer, huh?
08:22:30 &lt;isomer`&gt; incremental copying gc, not stop&amp;copy
08:23:09 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Generational GCs can still be, and usually are, based on stop &amp; copy...
08:23:47 &lt;isomer`&gt; well, most smalltalks have very small pause times -- tens of ms typically
08:23:49 * foof can't decide what GC to use
08:23:52 &lt;isomer`&gt; or less
08:24:22 &lt;Riastradh&gt; foof, Perry Cheng's incremental, concurrent, &amp; parallel GC!
08:24:34 * foof googles

2006-04-12

15:01:14 &lt;elibarzilay&gt; Riastradh: yes, they do have the same number of cons cells -- and I'm always amused at how this comes as a revelation in these arguments.
15:01:38 &lt;elibarzilay&gt; Soon enough you'll get someone to write some micro benchmark and claim that one is faster to deal with than the other.
15:02:10 &lt;elibarzilay&gt; And if you talk about parentheses-don't-matter you'll get the obvious &quot;But I see dots!&quot; guy jumping up and down.
15:02:21 &lt;Riastradh&gt; Oh, we already wasted lots of time doing that for SRFI 87 or whatever Joo ChurlSoo's latest absurdity is.
