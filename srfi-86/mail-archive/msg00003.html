 |I assume you mean &quot;other Scheme values&quot;, not expressions.  Doesn't the
 |following code bind the evaluated result of VALUES to a single variable?
 |
 |(call-with-values (lambda () (values 1 2 3))
 |  (lambda VALS
 |    VALS))

The VALS is not the evaluated result of (values 1 2 3) but a list which the
evaluated result is converted into.

 |QUOTE: Moreover, the pair of VALUES and CALL-WITH-VALUES is clumsy to use 
 |Is this a fact or an opinion? A SRFI would be more appealing to implementors 
 |if its rationale is based on facts.

If it is an inconvenient way that &quot;decomposition of multiple values is done by
simple application&quot;, it will be not a fact.



 |QUOTE: and somewhat slow under some circumstances.
 |How slow is &quot;somewhat slow&quot;?  How do you quantify it?  And what are the
 |circumstances that make VALUES and CALL-WITH-VALUES somewhat slow?  Or
 |do you really mean under some *implementations*?  Was the topic of
 |Efficient Implementation of Multiple Return Values in Scheme ever
 |discussed in the literature?

Even in Chez Petite Scheme and Scheme48 that have VALUES/CALL-WITH-VLUES
implemented with &quot;An Efficient Implementation of Multiple Return Values in
Scheme (<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/27481.html">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/27481.html</a>)&quot;, VALUES/CALL-WITH-VALUES is
somewhat slow under some circumstances.

The following are the results of simple tests &quot;on REPL&quot;.(Intel 586, Debian or
Windows)

		 (if (= x 0)
		     (mu 4 5 6)
		     (mu 7 8 9)))))
(define vv (lambda (x)
	     (if (&lt; x 0)
		 (values 1 2 3)
		 (if (= x 0)
		     (values 4 5 6)
		     (values 7 8 9)))))

 |QUOTE: A solution would be to enclose the arguments of VALUES expression
 |QUOTE: in a procedure of one argument, a consumer procedure of QUOTE:
 |CALL-WITH-VALUS.  How does this SRFI address the efficiency problem?  Looking
 |at the implementation section, I see many calls to
 |call-with-current-continuation. Is that not somewhat slow under some
 |circumstances? Looking further down, there are many recursive procedures and
 |many assignments that are performed at runtime.  Maybe your intension is to
 |have a reference implementation outlining the concept and implementors are
 |encouraged to provide their own implementations.  If that's the case, it may
 |be a good idea to state it in the implementation section.

How many calls to call-with-current-continuation are there?
CALL-WITH-CURRENT-CONTINUATION is used only once in implementation of ALET[*]
for escaspe function, so if you don't use the function, there will be no
problem.
Recursive procedures are the same.  They are used only for recursive function
like named-let[*].
There is only one additional assignment, in single value binding of ALET
implementation.  It is for sequential binding from left to right. 

Thanks for comments.
