<pre>Marc,

Thank you for your, as always, thoughtful response.  I also must apologize to 
you and this list for my tardy response.  I was not subscribed to the srfi-48 
discussion list and did not receive any missives.  Mea culpa!  

Fortunately, I did check the discussion archive.


&gt; Ken, I believe that format strings, as used in the proposed &quot;format&quot;
&gt; procedure as well as C's &quot;printf&quot;, is very wrong.

As I see it, the main reasons for a SRFI are to add value and reduce disorder 
by specifying common useful functionality across implementations to port code 
and programmers. 

In this context, I am attempting to reduce disorder among pre-existing FORMAT 
functions by proposing something which I feel would minimize changes while 
preserving some implementation history.

&gt; The first objection is that it is difficult to type check statically,
&gt; because it requires the parsing of the format string, which may be
&gt; computed at run time.

I agree that this is a classic problem.  I do not attempt to solve it here.

&gt; Secondly, it is hard to remember the meaning of the one letter
&gt; escapes.  How come &quot;~y&quot; does pretty-printing and not &quot;~p&quot;, how come
&gt; &quot;~%&quot; prints a newline instead of &quot;~n&quot;, etc, etc.

Alas, this is not a new design, but an attempt to codify a common practice.

Scheme48, T, MIT Scheme, Chez Scheme, SLIB, et cetera all implement some form 
of a FORMAT (sometimes called SPRINTF) function, much of this over 20 years 
ago.  

I am not attempting to specify the best mnemonics here -- just common 
historical ones.

&gt; Thirdly, the logical link between a particular escape in the format
&gt; string and the parameter it formats is not reinforced.  They are too
&gt; far appart in the source and it is easy to get the order wrong or
&gt; miss one parameter.

What is reinforced is the commonality between the format-string and the 
output.  I might point out that using large numbers of arguments to a format 
function should be considered bad style.

&gt; Finally it is not composable.  Scheme is a nice functional language
&gt; where we can define functions for each operation we need to do, and we
&gt; can easily compose one function with another to get new
&gt; functionnality.  With format strings these operations are hidden
&gt; behind escape codes that need the &quot;format&quot; interpreter to work.  Why
&gt; not expose those operations as true Scheme functions (that produce
&gt; strings or produce text on the current output port).

The functions, display, write, number-&gt;string, and pretty-print are already  
exposed.  In a more complete implementation, e.g. SLIB, there are field 
specifications for which the commonality of a &quot;format interpreter&quot; make 
sense.

I can see how formatted strings can be composed, but not side effects to ports 
(monads meet call/cc?).

&gt;...
&gt; Anyway, I don't want to get lost in details.  My main point is that a
&gt; functional interface is much more elegant and versatile that format
&gt; strings.

I do not disagree with you.

Again, the attempt here is to reduce dissonance while retaining continuity 
with past practice.  There is no attempt to increase elegance.

Cheers,
-KenD
