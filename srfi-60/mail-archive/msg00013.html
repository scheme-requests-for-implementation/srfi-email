... logical:ones, which generated an integer with the least
significant k bits set. Calls to bit-field could have replaced its
uses . But the definition was so short that I just replaced its uses
with:

(lognot (ash -1 k))

A procedure in slib/logical.scm, logical:rotate, rotated a given
number of low-order bits by a given number of bits.  This function was
quite servicable, but I could not name it adequately.  I have replaced
it with rotate-bit-field with the addition of a start argument.  This
new function rotates a given field (from positions start to end)
within an integer; leaving the rest unchanged.

_Function:_ *rotate-bit-field* /n count start end/
    Returns n with the bit-field from start to end cyclically permuted
    by count bits towards high-order.

    Example:

(number-&gt;string (rotate-bit-field #b0100 3 0 4) 2)
    =&gt; &quot;10&quot;
(number-&gt;string (rotate-bit-field #b0100 -1 0 4) 2)
    =&gt; &quot;10&quot;
(number-&gt;string (rotate-bit-field #b110100100010000 -1 5 9) 2)
    =&gt; &quot;110100010010000&quot;
(number-&gt;string (rotate-bit-field #b110100100010000 1 5 9) 2)
    =&gt; &quot;110100000110000&quot;

 | but the name and parameter ordering are more consistent with SRFI
 | 33's conventions as well.

SRFI-60 range arguments follow the SUBSTRING and array convention of
start (inclusive) and end (exclusive) positions as the last arguments
to the function.  I might choose differently if I were inventing a new
language, but Scheme preceedent is there.

 | &gt;  |   bit-reverse        -&gt; bitwise-reverse
 | &gt;
 | &gt; This one jumps bit-lanes.  I think bit-reverse is the better
 | &gt; description.
 | 
 | Yes, it probably is.  However, thinking about it now, perhaps it would
 | be better yet to offer a REVERSE-BIT-FIELD, like the ROTATE-BIT-FIELD I
 | suggested above.  It would be extended similarly; its prototype would
 | look like (REVERSE-BIT-FIELD &lt;size&gt; &lt;position&gt; &lt;i&gt;).

The bit-reverse procedure was then the only one remaining which took a
width argument. So I replaced it with reverse-bit-field.

_Function:_ *reverse-bit-field* /n start end/
    Returns n with the order of bits start to end reversed.

(number-&gt;string (reverse-bit-field #xa7 0 8) 16)
  =&gt; &quot;e5&quot;

 | &gt;  |   bitwise:laminate   -&gt; bitwise-laminate
 | &gt;  |   bitwise:delaminate -&gt; bitwise-delaminate
 | &gt;
 | &gt; I used bitwise because bits in corresponding lanes are extracted.
 | &gt; BIT-LAMINATE and BIT-DELAMINATE might be better.
 | 
 | Er, I don't follow: shouldn't that make BITWISE-... more suitable?  On
 | further consideration, however, I find myself wondering: in what sorts
 | of applications are these operations, and the Gray codes, useful?  They
 | seem fairly random to me for a general bitwise operations library.  All
 | the other operations, however, are very widely applicable.  I could be
 | wrong, of course, but even a quick grep through a number of your Scheme
 | packages -- SCM, SLIB, JACAL, FreeSnell, &amp; synch -- reveals only one
 | use of bit string lamination and Gray codes: in SLIB's phil-spc.scm,
 | which could just have easily locally defined the operations.

I moved the lamination procedures to phil-spc.scm.
