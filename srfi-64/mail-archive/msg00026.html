&gt; &gt;    (test-assert &quot;x&quot; #t)

&gt; &gt; then in an on-test hook executing for the test-assert, we have:

&gt; 
&gt; Yes.

I've added `test-runner-group-path' to my implementation and some tests 
for it.

&gt; 
&gt; I do think we should have call-back routins for test-begin/test-end [...]

In consistency with the other callbacks in the spec, I'd guess you imagine
something like `test-runner-on-test-{begin,end}[!]'.  Other ideas?  You
could make test-group have a seperate callback, or define it in terms of
begin/end.


&gt; &gt; Furthermore, note that the tests within an
&gt; &gt; explicit test group may be skipped using test-skip, but this is not true
&gt; &gt; for tests within an implicit test group.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; [I think it's wierd that you can't skip an implicit test group, just for 
&gt; &gt; symmetry.  Although I can't see implementing it so that all the forms are 
&gt; &gt; skipped, it might make sense to actually skip *tests* inside a skippable
&gt; &gt; implicit group.]
&gt; 
&gt; I'm inclined to agree.  I don't think the reference implementation does
&gt; it this way, but it should be difficult to fix.
&gt; 
&gt; For test-match-nth, should be count both the test-group/test-begin *and*
&gt; (assuming the test-group/test-begin is not skipped) the tests in it?
&gt; 
&gt; (test-skip 2) ;; Define this to mean skipping the 2nd following test.
&gt; (test-begin &quot;a&quot;)
&gt; (test-assert &quot;x1&quot;)
&gt; (test-assert &quot;x2&quot;)
&gt; (test-end &quot;a&quot;)
&gt; (test-assert &quot;x3&quot;)
&gt; 
&gt; Should we skip &quot;x2&quot; or &quot;x3&quot;?  I.e. do we count 1 for &quot;a&quot; as a unit, or 1
&gt; for &quot;a&quot; and 1 each for &quot;x1&quot;...&quot;x3&quot;.  The latter might be a little strange,
&gt; but perhaps more convenient - and easier to implement, since we can use
&gt; a single global counter.

I could see implementing it either way; I think it would be a matter of
whether you check the &quot;are-we-in-a-skipped-implicit-group?&quot; flag before or
after you call to check the specifiers in the current skip list.

I don't have a good intuition as to the use of test-match-nth -- is this 
something you've used elsewhere before?

In the absence of prior art, I'd suggest consistency with the use of 
test-group.  In other words, I'd like to preserve as much as possible the 
similarity between

   (test-begin &quot;a&quot;)
   ...
   (test-end &quot;a&quot;)

and

   (test-group &quot;a&quot; ...)

And clarify in the spec that the only reason they aren't equivalent (i.e.,
(1) the evaluation of non-test forms in the implicit-group case, and (2)  
the execution of the test-end in case of an exception) is to preserve the
sanity of the implementor.

In that case, we'd skip &quot;x3&quot;, since all of &quot;a&quot; would count as the 1st.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; For the purposes of test counting as checked by test-end, a test group (of
&gt; &gt; either variety) counts as a single test.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm open to discussion on this: perhaps it should count as a single test
&gt; *if it is skipped*.

I think I'm getting confused by the multiple ways of counting.  So, to 
clarify, there are three places that counting happens:

  (1) the counting of (usually) test cases, as reported by 
      `test-runner-*-count'.

  (2) the counting of substructures, as checked by `test-end' with
      the count option

  (3) the counting of skip candidates, as checked by the 
      stateful predicate `test-match-nth'.

The RScheme implementation notwithstanding, I'm thinking the following 
makes sense:

(2) and (3) should be unified and (1) should be clarified to count only
test cases and never test groups.

Furthermore, (3) does *not* involve short-circuited evaluation, and we
should introduce a new accessor, `test-runner-count-in-group' which
returns the position (1,2,3...) of the current test case in it's group.

Then test-match-nth looks more like:

(define (test-match-nth n #optional (count default: 1))
  (let ((i (test-runner-count-in-group (test-runner-current))))
    (and (&gt;= i n) (&lt;= i (+ n count -1)))))

[Although some tweak is necessary to suspend the processing during 
subgroups; you only want the skip to match at the same structural level.  
Maybe it should be `test-runner-count-in-group-path' and return the path 
of positions.]

This approach implies that test groups (explicit or implicit) should
always count at one structural element and never appear in
(test-runner-skip-count).
