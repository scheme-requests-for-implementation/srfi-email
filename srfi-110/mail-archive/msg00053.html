<pre>Hello all,

First of all, I should admit that I have only begun reading about sweet
expressions in the last hour or so.  I don't yet understand the rules.

I began to try to learn about them by jumping directly to the
&quot;Specification&quot; section of SRFI-110.  I'm sorry to say that I find that
section extraordinarily unclear.  Below, I've made notes about the parts
that I found confusing.

No doubt, I could find answers to all of these questions by reading the
rest of the document more carefully, and/or by reading the website of
the Readable Lisp S-expressions Project.  However, I don't think I
should have to.  The specification should stand on its own to a
reasonable extent, IMO anyway.

[In the list below, &quot;first list&quot;, &quot;second list&quot;, and &quot;third list&quot; refer
to the three numbered lists of rules in the &quot;Basic specification&quot;
section.]

* &quot;term&quot; is used before it is defined.

* The concepts of &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;child&quot; are not defined.

* The use of the term &quot;parameter&quot; is confusing.  This is a datum reader
  after all, which deals with &quot;lists&quot;, not &quot;parameters&quot;.  I'd prefer for
  it to describe more clearly what data structure is created.

* Item 1 (first list): What is an &quot;indented line&quot;?  Does that mean any
  line with non-empty indentation, or does it mean &quot;indented more than
  some other line&quot;?  If the latter, which other line?

* Item 3 (first list): Does &quot;multiple terms&quot; mean &quot;multiple terms on
  the same line&quot;?  If so, isn't this redundant with item 2 (but IMO
  more clearly stated)?

* Item 4 (first list): What is an &quot;empty line&quot;?  Is whitespace allowed?
  What about exclamation points?  What about comments?

* Item 6 (first list): What does &quot;prefixed&quot; mean?

* Are '!', '$', '\\', '$$$', '&lt;*' and '*&gt;' recognized as special tokens
  only if they are surrounded by whitespace?  (All of these characters
  except for backslash are considered extended alphabetic characters in
  standard scheme.)

* Later in the design rationale, it is mentioned in passing that '!'
  is only recognized as indentation at the beginning of a line.  Does
  that mean before any whitespace?  If so, that fact should be
  mentioned in the specification (which currently suggests that '!'
  could mixed freely with spaces or tabs).

* Item 1 (second list): What are lines with &quot;initial indent&quot;?  What
  happens if a line is not consistently indented?  What is meant by
  &quot;preceding line&quot;?  Does that mean &quot;preceding non-empty line&quot;?  (if
  so, what does &quot;empty line&quot; mean?)

* Item 3 (second list): What does &quot;completely ignored&quot; mean?  How does
  this relate to the &quot;preceding line&quot; of item 1 (second list)?

* Is '!' considered whitespace?

* Item 5 (second list): What does it mean for an expression to &quot;start
  indented&quot;?

* Item 6 (second list): Do datum comments ignore intervening '!'
  characters as well?

* In the rules that say neoteric expression are read (not sweet
  expressions), how are '!', '$', '\\' and '$$$' handled?

* Item 7 (second list): What does it mean exactly that block comments
  are &quot;removed&quot;?

* Item 1 (third list): Regarding GROUP, what does it mean &quot;it
  represents no symbol at all, located at that indentation&quot;?

* Item 2 (third list): What does &quot;restart list processing&quot; mean?  What
  is &quot;the right-hand-side&quot;?  What are &quot;its sub-blocks&quot;?  What happens
  if there's more than one '$' on a line?

* Item 3 (third list): Does &quot;indentation&quot; mean &quot;non-empty
  indentation&quot;?  (and does that definition apply generally?)  In the
  &quot;entire sweet-expression that follows&quot; what is considered the
  indentation of the first line of that expression?

* Item 4 (third list): What are &quot;un-indented sweet expressions&quot;?

* Why is there a distinction made between &quot;advanced sweet-expression
  features&quot; and the rest of the spec?

* In the paragraph immediately following the third list:

   * &quot;MUST only be accepted ... is active&quot;
      =&gt; &quot;MUST NOT be accepted ... is not active&quot;

   * When are sweet expressions accepted but &quot;indentation processing&quot;
     is not active?  (in collecting lists?)

   * What does it mean that a &quot;character sequence&quot; begins with
     &quot;exactly the marker's first character&quot;?  In &quot;{$}&quot;, why is the '$'
     not considered a &quot;character sequence&quot;?

* IMO, it should probably be specified whether &quot;#!no-sweet&quot; disables
  curly-infix.

* In the examples, why are the s-expressions not indented according to
  the nearly-universally accepted conventions?

* The use of '$', '$$$', '&lt;*', and '*&gt;' as special tokens should be
  mentioned in the &quot;Backwards compatibility&quot; section.  These are all
  considered extended alphabetic characters by standard scheme.

* If an implementation implements sweet expressions by default, then
  they will have to be careful about writing symbols that contain '$',
  '&lt;*' or '*&gt;'.

* In the design rationale, there's a section entitled &quot;Blank lines&quot;.
  Are these the same as the &quot;empty lines&quot; referenced in the
  specification?  If so, I suggest using just one term, and defining
  it clearly in the spec.

* When you speak of &quot;traditional abbreviations&quot;, you might want to
  make a suggestion about how to handle additional non-standard
  abbreviations.  In particular, the abbreviations #', #`, #, and #,@
  are widely used by the syntax-case macro system.

    Regards,
      Mark
