<pre>Investment proposal from:
Dr. Rotimi Ademola.
Tel: 234 804 2136866
Fax: 234 17 597626 
Block 4 Federal Secretariat Road,
Ikoyi-Lagos. 

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 

I am  Dr. Rotimi Ademola  the chairman of contract award 
and review committee set up by the federal government 
of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to 
award new contracts and review existing ones. 

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and 
Reputable person to handle a very confidential 
transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum 
of money to a foreign account. There were series of 
contracts executed by a consortium of multinationals 
in the oil industry in favour of the Nigerian National Petroleum 
Cooperation (N.N.P.C.) the original  value of these contracts were 
deliberately over  invoiced to the sum of Usd$25,000,000.00 (twenty five 
million united state Dollars). 

This amount has been approved and is now ready to 
be transferred being that the companies that actually 
executed these contracts have been fully paid and the 
projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my 
colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total 
amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, 
since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code 
of conduct bureau (civil Service law) from operating 
and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless 
to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is 
enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% 
of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside 
for Incidental expenses (internal and external) 
between both parties in the course of the transaction 
you will be mandated to remit the balance to other 
accounts in due course. 

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level 
of the ministry of finance and the central bank of 
Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 
14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the 
above stated terms. our assurance is that your role is 
Risk free and to accord this transaction the legality 
It deserves and for mutual security of the funds the 
whole approval procedures will officially and legally 
processed with your name or the name of any company 
you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary. Once 
more I want you to understand that having put in over 
twenty five years in the civil service of my country, 
I am averse to having my image and career dented. This 
matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy 
and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify 
your intention to assist by sending me a fax on my 
confidential fax number ( 234 17 597626) so that I 
can brief you further. I want to assure you that this 
business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done 
our homework properly. I quite believe that you will 
protect our interest by taking this deal strictly 
confidential, as we are still in government service, 
which we intend to retire from. Kindly expedite action 
as we are behind schedule to enable us include this 
transfer in the first batch which would constitute the 
first quarter payments for the 2003 financial year. 

Thanks and God bless. 

Dr. Rotimi Ademola.
