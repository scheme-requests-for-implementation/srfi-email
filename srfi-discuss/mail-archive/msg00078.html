[Please pardon if this was posted to the list twice. I had *thought* I'd 
subscribed to the list earlier in the week, but when I first tried to send 
this, I was informed I was not a subscriber; apparently, I had subscribed 
to the announcements list only. I now should be properly subscribed.]<br>
<br>
I was wondering about various issues relating to the SRFIs and this list.<br>
<br>
To start with, I was wondering if there was a general consensus as to what 
sort of things would and would not be suitable for defining in an SRFI. How 
specialized a library definition have to be before it would be seen as too 
specific to make a suitable SRFI?<br>
<br>
To what extent is elegance and appropriate style and idioms important? Do 
SRFIs have a political or proselyting role?<br>
<br>
For example, suppose I were to propose (as I may well do, if it is 
suitable) an SRFI for a simple collection of iterators and conditional 
forms along the following lines:<br>
<br>
(when cond expr1 expr2 ...)     ; a simple conditional form with no else<br>
(unless cond expr1 expr2 ...)   ; a conditional like when, but operates on 
false<br>
(while cond expr1 expr2 ...)    ; simple while iterator<br>
(until cond expr1 expr2 ...)    ; while-not iterator<br>
(for (x from start to finish) expr1 expr2 ...) ; for iterator<br>
(visit vec range x from i to i-prime cond expr1 expr2 ...) ; iterator to 
visit all members of a vector in range [i...i-prime)<br>
<br>
and so forth. Part of the obvious justification for such a library would be 
that it would be more familiar to programmers who were used to procedural 
languages. Would such a purely 'political' motive be considered a valid 
argument in favor of an SRFI, either alone or as part of a broader 
argument? Would the 'un-Scheme-like' qualities of such a library be a 
negative factor?<br>
<br>
(While I'm at it, could anyone recommend any additional general-purpose 
conditionals, iterators, predicates, logical operators or functionals? 
Would such a collection constitute a single SRFI or several?)<br>
<br>
How far-reaching should SRFIs be? For example, would it be seen as valid to 
offer a common 'wrapper' interface for FFI forms (as the Draft SRFI 50 more 
or less does)? An object system (as the withdrawn SRFI 20 did)? A standard 
set of OpenGL bindings? At which point does it cease to be a 'standard' 
library?<br>
<br>
What relationship, if any, do the SRFIs have with actual libraries such as 
SLIB? With Scheme software archives such as CSAN or SUNet?<br>
<br>
Has the standards process for R6RS Scheme had any impact on the SRFI 
process, and if so, how?<br>
<br>
I would be interested in hearing what people say about these issues.<br>
