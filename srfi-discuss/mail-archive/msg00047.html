<pre>ATT.
SIR,
You may be surprised to receive this letter from
me
since you do not know me personally. I am Mohammed
Idris, the first son of Tawanda Idris,the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who was murdered in
the land dispute in my country. I got your contact
through network online hence decided to write you.
Before the death of my father, he had taken me to
Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US8.6 million
(Eight million, Six Hundred thousand United States
dollars), in one of the private security company,
as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this
money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid
much demurrage from security company. This amount
was meant for the purchase of new machines and
chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new&gt;
farms in Swaziland.
This land problem came when Zimbabwean President&gt;
Mr.
Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform
wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some
few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing
and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some
lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people
were killed because of this Land reform Act for
which my father was one of the victims.&gt;
It is against this background that, I and my family
fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are
currently staying in the Netherlands where we are
seeking political asylum and moreso have decided to
transfer my father’s money to a more reliable
foreign account. since the law of Netherlands
prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any
bank account or to be involved in any financial
transaction throughout the territorial zone of
Netherlands, As the eldest son of my father, I am
saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine
foreign account where this money could be
transferred without the knowledge of my government
who are bent on taking everything we have got. The
South African government seems to be playing along&gt;
with them.
I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of
money out of South Africa for fear of going through
the same experience in future, both countries have
similar political history. As a businessman,I am
seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my
future and that of my family in his hands, I must
let you know that this transaction is risk free. If
you accept to assist me and my family, all I want
you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with
the security company to clear the consignment(funds)
from their afiliate office here in the Netherlands
as i have already given directives for the
consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from
South Africa.But before then all modalities will
have to be put in place like change of ownership to
the consignment
and more importantly this money I intend to use
for investmentment.
I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose
to have certain percentage of the money for
nominating your account for this transaction. Or you
can go into partnership with me for the proper
profitable investment of the money in your country.
Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify
me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all
kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this&gt;
transaction.
If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to
give you 10% of the money while the remaining 85%
will be for my investment in your country. Contact&gt;
me
with my E-mail. [mustapha22003@yahoo.com]
address
while I implore you to maintain the absolute
secrecy required in this transaction.
Thanks, GOD BLESS YOU
Yours Faithfully,
Mohammed Idris
