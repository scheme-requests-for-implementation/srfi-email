<pre>I do not believe in providing library functions for arbitrary special
cases that might all be expressed in terms of a single more general
function. In fact, I consider this attitude to be one of the great
differences between Scheme and Common Lisp. Several of the comments
below are biased by this conviction.


4.1 Constructors

The function vector-iota is simply a not particularly interesting
special case of the function vector-tabulate. Is the desire to mimic
SRFI-1, which in turn is inspired by APL, sufficient to introduce this
function?


4.2 Predicates

Is the pathological case of a vector with no elements really common
enough to warrant the introduction of two predicates that could be
implemented in terms of vector-length? Lists and vectors are pretty
different in this regard.


4.3 Accessors

While first, second, etc. are certainly more legible than car, cadr,
etc., this does not apply to vector-first and friends, which are
simply not-so-short shorthands for (vector-ref vec index). Indeed,
since the indices of vectors are zero-based, the ordinals might even
be considered misleading. Of course, this also applies to list-ref,
but referring to list elements by index seems to be less common in the
lisp community.

The vector-take and vector-drop functions are all variations of a
single theme, namely selecting a sub-vector, and could all be replaced
by the function vector-copy, defined as a constructor in section
4.1. In this regard, vector-copy is more powerful than the function
list-copy defined by SRFI-1.


4.4 Miscellaneous

I am not sure whether the limitations of some scheme implementations
with regard to the length of argument lists should enter into the
definition of a SRFI. If it should not, the function
vector-concatentate* is simply superfluous, and even if it should, the
function is inappropriately named, as the asterisk usually implies
left-to-right evaluation rather than a certain argument type.

Nor is the name of the function vector-zip very helpful, as &quot;zipping&quot;
usually refers to some kind of compression. And again, is all this
&quot;unzipping&quot; really common enough to warrant the definition of five
additional functions? And yes, this also applies to SRFI-1.


4.5 Iterators

If vector-unfold is the fundamental vector constructor, it should be
defined in 4.1 and not 4.5. Moreover, vector-unfold is hardly a
suitable name for a constructor. As the function is similar to &quot;do&quot;
returning a vector, the syntax might be changed to reflect this
similarity. On the other hand, this would break the similarity to
SRFI-1.

Given a not too inefficient implementation of vector-reverse, which
should be possible, the whole issue of left/right iteration would seem
rather pointless.


4.9 Association Vectors

Who needs association vectors in addition to association lists and
hash tables? What are their advantages? Or is a strict translation of
SRFI-1 the main motivation for their definition?


Disclaimer: I realize that many of the names shadow those introduced
by SRFI-1, but that does not necessarily make them any better.
