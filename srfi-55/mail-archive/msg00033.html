&gt; &gt; an embedded or seprate configuration language.  It is just _not_ a
&gt; &gt; relevant issue.)
&gt; 
&gt; I think your preferences are quite clear.

Were you reading anything but the second &amp; third clauses of the second
parenthesized sentence  there?  It is _NOT_ a relevant issue; what you
just said provides _nothing_ to the discussion.

&gt; &gt; Why should individual people arbitrarily alienate certain select
&gt; &gt; implementations just because of a certain property of their module
&gt; &gt; systems, when a solution that would _not_ alienate them is readily
&gt; &gt; possible?  Convenience, anyways, is _hardly_ at issue here, as I have
&gt; &gt; demonstrated that SRFI 7 requires only a _few_more_keystrokes_ than
&gt; &gt; SRFI 55.
&gt; 
&gt; I have answered that already. Apparently not to your full satisfaction.
&gt; I have nothing to add.

You have given _no_answer_ but 'my tastes disagree,' and your tastes
are _nowhere_near_ as important as valid technical merit, which you
have given _no_ indication of in this SRFI.  Saying 'it's too
complicated' is, first of all, entirely subjective -- there go your
tastes again --, and moreover demonstrably over-dramatized.

&gt; &gt;&gt;To reiterate:
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;a) SRFI-55 provides functionality that SRFI-7 doesn't specify (i.e.
&gt; &gt;&gt;    loading/making accessible SRFI functionality), regardless how
&gt; &gt;&gt;    you twist the SRFI-7 specification, or the possible ways how it
&gt; &gt;&gt;    could be interpreted.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This problem is _easily_solved_ with a suggestion I have made _many_
&gt; &gt; times -- though which you seem to have readily ignored --: just make an
&gt; &gt; amendment to SRFI 7 that specifies this!
&gt; 
&gt; No, I won't do that. Otherwise SRFI-55 wouldn't have been submitted.

Huh?  SRFI 55 wouldn't have been submitted if it were merely an
amendment to SRFI 7?

&gt; I don't like SRFI-7, for reasons that I already described.

This alone is _no_reason_ to deliberately alienate certain module
systems.

&gt; &gt; No, it is flawed according to _NOT_ just my taste.  SRFI 7 _is_ only
&gt; &gt; according to your taste.  There is _considerable_ difference.  SRFI 7
&gt; &gt; is implementable across an _even_broader_ range of implementations, yet
&gt; &gt; _all_you_consider_ here is the range that _your_implementation_ fits
&gt; &gt; in! 
&gt; 
&gt; Interesting, but one could say that SRFI-7 is rather unpopular, because
&gt; very few implementations support it. Not that this is in any way
&gt; important, but it may indicate that I'm not entirely alone with my
&gt; disliking of it.

As I said earlier, a significant reason for why SRFI 7 isn't widely
used because it's not very widely implemented, and a significant reason
that it's not widely implemented because it's not widely used.  That's
no basis for technical argument.

&gt; &gt; If you want your implementation to support this sort of thing,
&gt; &gt; _go_ahead_, but _don't_ impose your own system on everyone else when
&gt; &gt; _not_everyone_ can support it!  On the other hand, you _CAN_ support
&gt; &gt; SRFI 7, as can the implementations you _alienate_, but you reject it
&gt; &gt; _just_because_it's_not_quite_as_concise_as_you_might_prefer_!
&gt; 
&gt; You seem to be rather agitated, Taylor.

What a useful response.  Do you have one any less useful, or do you
implicitly concede the point?

(I get one free sarcastic comment because of yours in your last email!)

&gt; &gt;&gt;c) That some (one, effectively) implementations are not able to support
&gt; &gt;&gt;    something along SRFI-55 is unfortunate, but should not restrict
&gt; &gt;&gt;    the abilities of other implementations. Yes, I consider those
&gt; &gt;&gt;    implementations &quot;broken&quot; in that regard, you are of course free
&gt; &gt;&gt;    to disagree.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; First of all, SRFI 7 does _NOT_ restrict other implementations, while
&gt; &gt; SRFIs 0 &amp; 55 _DO_, so you're just arguing against yourself! 
&gt; 
&gt; Am I? I don't get the impression.

You just said that certain implementations shouldn't restrict others.
SRFI 55 -- effectively, Chicken, for the sake of this point -- is
restricting Schemes to module systems that embed module data in Scheme
code, whereas SRFI 7 is not.  Therefore you just contradicted yourself
by saying that certain implementations shouldn't restrict others while
at the same time supporting one that does.

&gt; &gt;                                                              Second,
&gt; &gt; you have arbitrarily asserted that module systems that separate module
&gt; &gt; data from source code are inherently broken, with _absolutely_no_
&gt; &gt; _consideration_ of _technical_merit_; your _ONLY_ argument against them
&gt; &gt; has been your personal taste!
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen numerous people being quite confused with this separation
&gt; (as in Scheme48, for example), especially newbies. I don't think
&gt; this should be necessary. Easy things should be easy, in my opinion.

Most newbies are confused by higher-order &amp; anonymous closures, too.
Maybe we ought to just get rid of them.

It _is_ easy already, and it just requires a little bit of explanation
to some newbies, just as higher-order &amp; anonymous closures do.  I know
from experience that newbies tend to lose confusion quickly about the
Scheme48 module system after a decent explanation.

&gt; Defining a new language just to have access to a few list-processing
&gt; functions is too much (IMHO), but I've said that before...

The innocent 'just to have access to a few list-processing functions'
is vastly disguising the real purpose.  Why define a new language just
to manipulate some bits in memory?  It's for a more sophisticated
purpose than 'just a few list-processing functions': it's a dependency
specification language.  Why define a new file format for Debian or
DarwinPorts or whatever packages?  If all you want to make use of is a
certain feature of it -- the REQUIRES clause --, you don't need to
encumber yourself with the rest of the language, but for those who _do_
use the rest of the language, it _should_ be there, and it should
_also_ not be specified so that it can't work in certain environments
just due to the arbitrary taste of Felix Winkelmann.

&gt; &gt;&gt;d) Ease of use is an important issue to me, even if it offends some
&gt; &gt;&gt;    people's idea of what's the &quot;Right Thing&quot; or not.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ease of use is important, yes, but _allowing_ for use is necessary for
&gt; &gt; ease of use!  Furthermore, using SRFI 7 requires only a _few_more_
&gt; &gt; _keystrokes_ than SRFI 55, which does _not_ exactly make it
&gt; &gt; extraordinarily difficult.
&gt; 
&gt; No, but more complicated than necessary.

Compare:

(require-extension (srfi 1)) ...
(program (requires srfi-1) (code ...))

Is that _REALLY_ much more complicated?
