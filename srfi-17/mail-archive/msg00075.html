<pre>
	Throughout this message, a 'compiler' stands for a genuine
compiler from Scheme to machine codes, as well as a byte-compiler,
pre-compiler, etc. Furthermore, the word compiler will also refer to a
human being who is reading and trying to understand a piece of Scheme
code.

	To start up, difficult aliasing issues exist in R5RS
Scheme. Consider for example,

(let ((a (list 1 2 3)) (b #t))
    (foo a) (bar b) (display a))

where 
	(define aG #f)
	(define (foo x) (set! aG x))
	(define (bar x) (set-cdr! aG #f))

The invocation of bar seemingly has nothing to do with 'a'. However,
after that invocation the contents of a cons cell named 'a' has
changed: this cell has been aliased by foo into aG. These aliasing
issues are similar to those a C compiler has to struggle with. Because
of the possibility of aliasing the compiler can't employ aggressive
caching.

	However, even in the example above, even if one of the
functions 'foo' or 'bar' choose to capture continuations, the compiler
can be certain about one thing: the variable 'a' will continue to
denote a pair (a cons-cell). Moreover, the variable 'a' continues to
denote _the same_ pair (as told by eq?). The contents of this cell may
change, yet its binding to the variable remains. Consider:

(let* ((a (list 1 2 3)) (b #t) (c a))
  (foo a) (display (eq? c a))
  (bar b) (display (eq? c a))
  (display a))

No matter what foo and bar do, (eq? c a) holds. 

	The only way variable 'a' can be changed to name something
different is by a set! executed within a scope. Speaking in OO terms,
set-car!, string-set! etc. mutators change the state of an object
named by a variable, but do not change that object's identity. On the
other hand, only set! can change the object's identity. Here identity
means identical with respect to eq?. Identity also means value's
type. For example:

(let ((a (list 1 2 3)))
  (foo a) (let ((b (cdr a))) ...))

The compiler can be positive that no matter what foo does (including
aliasing of the list or capturing continuations), after (foo a)
completes 'a' will still be a pair. The contents of a 'car' or 'cdr'
slots might've have changed, but 'a' will remain a pair. Therefore, a
smart compiler can elide a typecheck in (let ((b (cdr a))) as it is
unnecessary. A possibility for a type inference (performed by smart
compilers like Stalin and Rice's soft-type system) and eliding of
run-time type checks is usually considered a significant benefit.

	Assignment statement in Java and similar languages as well as
in ML are rather different from set! in Scheme. An assignment in Java
cannot change the declared type of a variable. An assignment of a
value which is incompatible with variable's type is an error in Java
-- but not in Scheme. The statements
	a = new Pair(b,c);
	a.fst = d;
are far more &quot;similar&quot; in Java than the expressions
	(set! a (cons b c))
	(set-car! a d)
in Scheme. In Java, a compiler knows that the type of 'a's value
before the assignment is _always_ the same as that after the
assignment. In Scheme, this holds only for set-car!, vector-set!
etc. mutators. set! is the only one mutator that can change the type
of the value a variable refers to.

Specification

	A generalized state mutator still appears to be a good
idea. Because set! is so unique in its actions, it appears a good idea
not to overload this name. The purpose of the generalized set seems to
be altering the state of an &quot;object&quot; rather than changing its
identity. Therefore, a name more appropriate to that action ought to
be chosen, e.g,. setl!, setf! or setg!

I'd like to propose to specify setg! as follows:
	SETG! (PROC ARG ...) VAL1 VAL2 ...
where PROC is an expression that evaluates to a procedural value. ARG
and VAL are arbitrary expressions returning a defined value. A
procedure yielded by PROC should take as many arguments as ARG ... The
semantics attached to the above expression is as follows:
  if expression (PROC ARG ...) yields OLD-VAL1 OLD-VAL2 ... OLD-VALN
then the first expression (PROC ARG ...) right after a successful
evaluation of
	SETG! (PROC ARG ...) VAL1 VAL2 ... VALN
should result in values VAL1 VAL2 ... VALN

The case &quot;setg! var value&quot; is specifically excluded by the above
syntax.  SETG! can accomplish its actions by invoking a setter
procedure that has been associated with the PROC beforehand. Or SETG!
can re-write PROC's name (if PROC is a symbol), for example, xxx-ref
will become xxx-set!. This as well as the order of ARGs and VALs in
setter's invocation becomes more or less an implementation detail.


Why locations are dangerous

The only way a variable can be changed to name something different is
by a set! executed within a scope -- a lexically apparent
set!. Consider

  (letrec ((a 1)
           (foo (lambda (x)
	     (if (some-test x) (set! a (some-fn x))))))
        (foo a) (bar a))

Now the compiler truly can't make any prediction about 'a' after (foo
a) completes. Note however how this is different from

	(define a #f)
	(define foo
	   (lambda (x) (if (some-test x) (set! a (some-fn x)))))
	(let ((a 1)) (foo a) (bar a))

In the latter case, the compiler is certain that 'a' remains an
integer (moreover, a FIXNUM 1) after (foo a) finishes. To be sure
that a particular variable keeps its original binding, the compiler
only needs to examine code and function definitions _within a local
scope_. The compiler does not need to chase functions defined
elsewhere -- only those that are apparent in the scope and have been
scanned.

	The promise that no function external to a lexical environment
can ever change that lexical environment is a strong and useful
commitment. It makes Scheme code easier to reason about -- both by a
compiler and a programmer. A programmer only needs to look through
code defined within a local scope to see if the local environment will
be changed or preserved. Introduction of locations or first-class
environments takes this 'locality' commitment away. Consider for
example,
	(define Global-pa #f)
	(define (foo px) (set! Global-pa px))
	(define (bar) (set! (Global-pa) (list 1 2 3)))
	(let ((a 1)) (foo (location a)) (bar) ...)

An external function bar can now manipulate a binding of a local
variable 'a' any way it wishes to. To make sure that a variable
preserves its binding (type), a compiler now has to examine not only
functions defined within the scope but also all the functions called
within the scope. A simple type inference will now entail a global,
inter-procedural flow analysis -- which is significantly more complex.

	With locations, the compiler can no longer be sure what a
variable denotes. The compiler has to insert full runtime checks
everywhere. There is a great wisdom in a decision not to grant
environments first-class status. Otherwise, a local scope is no longer
local as any external function can create and alter local, private
bindings. This would make Scheme a fully dynamically-scoped language,
like e-Lisp. That is usually considered not a good thing.


BTW, introduction of 'locations' does not appear necessary for a
Scheme code to be able to access absolute memory addresses or use
memory shared with other processes. The existing set of final SRFIs
provides tools for doing such low-level, hardware-related operations.

	On a UNIX platform, any process can open /dev/kmem or /dev/mem
or /proc/proc-id/mem and wreck any havoc it is allowed to, with
familiar read/write/lseek operations.

Furthermore, one can imagine a function
	make-absolute-u8vector ADDR LEN
which, given ADDR and LEN, verifies that this range of addresses does
not interfere with Scheme system's heap and other internal data
structures, mmaps the address range appropriately and returns a
uniform byte vector (per SRFI-4). With this function one can easily
write drivers for FireWire or PCI devices (which use memory-mapped
i/o) in Scheme.

One can also imagine a form:
	(define-record-type shmem-pare
	 (kons shmem-id x y)
	shmem-pare?
	(x kar set-kar!)
	(y kdr))

which denotes a record (SRFI-9) whose body is in a shared memory
segment. According to SRFI-9, slots of a record object should be
mutated only be appropriate setter procedures. The set-kar! mutator
can copy the assignable value into the shared memory segment if needed
(making sure that there are no references from a shared memory segment
to a private heap of a process). This procedure can make handling of a
shared memory segment significantly less painful (compared to C).
Again, both of the above procedures are easily implementable, and
neither needs the concept of locations or first-class environments.
