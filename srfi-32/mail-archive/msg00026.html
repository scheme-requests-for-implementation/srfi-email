<pre>   I've just read through the SRFI-32 draft and scanned the archive of the
   email discussion list.

Great review, Steck. Thank you very much!

   Maybe I'm near-sighted, but where is the reference implementation?
   David Feuer asked the same question on the discussion list, and I didn't
   see a response.

I think I responded. I haven't released the ref implementation. I still
need to clean up one of the routines, and I have been putting my SRFI
time into the discussion &amp; spec.

     - &quot;an SRFI&quot; -&gt; &quot;a SRFI&quot; (? depends on how you pronounce &quot;SRFI&quot; :-))

     - in the snippet of code that follows &quot;The definition is rather
   different, given a &lt;= comparator:&quot;, you should transpose `x' and `y' for
   one of the arguments to `and'

     - in the section on types of parameters and return values, it uses the
   word &quot;unspecified&quot;; in the descriptions of procedures, this mutates to
   &quot;unspecific&quot;

     - `list-merge!' is described as &quot;iterative, not recursive&quot;.  Hmmm,
   that's a bit confusing to me -- I'd just write &quot;iterative&quot;.

All fixed.

     - under `sort-lib', in the type for `vector-delete-neighbor-dups!',
   the return value is named end'.  Hmmm, I'd avoid using a quote there,
   and name it end2.  This name is used a couple of other places, I think.

I kinda like END'.

     - in the description of START and END, `v' is lower-case in
   (vector-length v), then upper-case in `where V ...'.  But this text may
   be redundant, since the same setup is already described in the section
   &quot;All vector operations accept optional subrange parameters&quot;.

     - there is a general inconsistency in the capitalization of procedure
   names, or maybe I don't understand why they're in upper-case in certain
   places, and lower-case in others
   
I need to make a pass to make capitalisation consistent.

     - in the type for `vector-merge!', the first optional argument is
   given as `start', but later mentioned as `START0' (inconsistent
   capitalization? as well as the `0')

I replaced START0/END0 with START/END uniformly.

     - I don't understand the comment on &quot;Pure list merge sort&quot; that begins
   &quot;and possibly better ...&quot; and what the &quot;above&quot; refers to.

I changed &quot;better&quot; to &quot;O(n),&quot; producing
    Stable and fast -- O(n lg n) worst-case, and possibly O(n), depending
    upon the input list (see above).
&quot;Above&quot; means the three paragraphs *immediately above*.

     - it's stated that the `LIST-SORTED?' function *will* return false
   given a &lt;= comparator and a list with adjacent equal elements.  I think
   that depends on the semantics of `LIST-SORTED?' (the intended semantics
   is described later in the SRFI).  Maybe &quot;may&quot; is a better word choice
   here, before the reader has seen that semantics.

No, the semantics is fixed, so &quot;may&quot; isn't the right word. It *will*.
Maybe I should reorder the text.

     - after a lengthy discussion of why &lt; is better than &lt;=, there's a
   reference to Common Lisp's similar choice.  I'd put that before your own
   explanation, and say something like &quot;While I don't know CL's reasons for
   that choice, here are my own.&quot;

I don't really *have* any good reasons for using &lt;, other than it is the
common practice. That section *doesn't* say one is better than the other,
just that they are quite different, and what the implications of that
difference are.

    - `vector-delete-neighbor-dups{!}' is described twice, as part of
   sortlib and delndup-lib.  Also, the description that it implements a
   linear-time algorithm appears twice (well, the second time, that also
   applies to the list deletion procedures).

Yeah, I know, and you are correct to push me to do something about this
redundancy. I will reflect on this.

   A more substantive comment:

     - I don't understand why there are four vector sort libraries.
   Presumably, there's not a lot of code there.  Couldn't they go into just
   one library?

I don't see why you should have to link in six different sort libraries
just to get heapsort.

   On the order of arguments issue: I'd be in favor of putting the
   procedure argument in front of list/vector data, uniformly.  If this
   SRFI is widely-adopted, most of the procedure names will be new in most
   implementations.  So you may as well do the right thing now, rather than
   have to live with a bad decision for years to come.  It also helps to
   distinguish Scheme from C, whose quicksort() puts the comparator last.
   :-)

This seems to be the consensus, to my pleasant surprise. I'm waiting to
hear from a few more implementors.

   I hope you find these comments useful.

Very. Thanks. May I forward your msg to the SRFI mailing list / archive?
