<pre style="margin: 0em;">
I thank the authors of this proposal for their work.

</pre><tt>I'm not entirely sure that I understand the the thrust of this  
</tt><tt>proposal, or fully comprehend what this proposal encompasses, but I  
</tt><tt>would like to go through it carefully and propose certain questions  
</tt><tt>and comments.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">



</pre><tt>&gt;    Should the R5RS procedures for generic arithmetic (e.g. +)  
</tt><tt>remain in R6RS? Here are five possible answers, phrased in terms of  
</tt><tt>the + procedure:
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;
&gt;       1. + is not defined in R6RS.
</pre><tt>&gt;       2. + is defined to be a synonym for the ex+, so its domain  
</tt><tt>is restricted to exact arguments, and always returns an exact result.
</tt><tt>&gt;       3. + is defined as the union of the ex+ and in+ procedures,  
</tt><tt>so all of its arguments are required to have the same exactness, and  
</tt><tt>the exactness of its result is the same as the exactness of its  
</tt><tt>arguments.
</tt><tt>&gt;       4. + is defined as in R5RS, but with the increased  
</tt><tt>portability provided by requiring the full numeric tower. This  
</tt><tt>alternative is described in the section R5RS-style Generic Arithmetic.
</tt><tt>&gt;       5. + is defined to return an exact result in all cases, even  
</tt><tt>if one or more of its arguments is inexact. This alternative is  
</tt><tt>described in the section Generic Exact Arithmetic.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;
&gt;    Will Clinger prefers the 4th possibility, Mike Sperber the 5th.

</pre><tt>I have real difficulties with 5, which I hope to expand on at a later  
</tt><tt>time.  Part of the problem is that 5 assumes that inexact-&gt;exact  
</tt><tt>gives reasonable results on inexact arguments, and I can't see how  
</tt><tt>this can be true if, for example, inexacts are implemented as the  
</tt><tt>computable reals.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>&gt;    The real?, rational?, and integer? predicates must return false  
</tt><tt>for complex numbers with an imaginary part of inexact zero, as non- 
</tt><tt>realness is now contagious. This causes possibly unexpected behavior:  
</tt><tt>`(zero? 0+0.0i)' returns true despite `(integer? 0+0.0i)' returning  
</tt><tt>false. Possibly, new predicates realistic?, rationalistic?, and  
</tt><tt>integral? should be added to say that a number can be coerced to the  
</tt><tt>specified type (and back) without loss. (See the Design Rationale.)
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I don't like the word contagious; I cannot think of a rigorous  
</tt><tt>definition in many contexts (including this one).
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>&gt;    Most Scheme implementations represent an inexact complex number  
</tt><tt>as a pair of two inexact reals, representing the real and imaginary  
</tt><tt>parts of the number, respectively. Should R6RS mandate the presence  
</tt><tt>of such a representation (while allowing additional alternative  
</tt><tt>representations), thus allowing it to more meaningfully discuss  
</tt><tt>semantic issues such as branch cuts?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Yes.

</pre><tt>&gt;    Should `(floor +inf.0)' return +inf.0 or signal an error  
</tt><tt>instead? (Similarly for ceiling, flfloor, infloor, etc.)
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>It should *be* an error, whether it should *signal* an error is  
</tt><tt>another matter.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>&gt;    The bitwise operations operate on exact integers only. Should  
</tt><tt>they live in the section on exact arithmetic?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I don't see this as an important issue?

&gt;    Should they carry ex prefixes?

no.

&gt;     Or should they be extended to work on inexact integers as well?

Just exact integers.

</pre><tt>&gt;    +nan.0 represents the result of (/ 0.0 0.0), and may represent  
</tt><tt>other NaNs as well. (This SRFI does not require read/write invariance  
</tt><tt>for NaNs.)
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>OK, but writing a NaN should give whatever info is in the  
</tt><tt>significand.   There seems to be no way to get that information using  
</tt><tt>Scheme procedures described in this document.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Basically, I believe that the programming languages &quot;Scheme&quot;, which  
</tt><tt>we can specify, should &quot;play well with others&quot;, where &quot;others&quot;  
</tt><tt>include hardware and OS runtime libraries, which are specified either  
</tt><tt>by hardware companies, or by other standards bodies.  The hardware  
</tt><tt>and runtime libraries of different systems generate different NaNs,  
</tt><tt>and if we're going to go to this amount of trouble to add what I hope  
</tt><tt>will be useful flonum arithmetic to Scheme, some way should be  
</tt><tt>provided in Scheme to distinguish NaNs that are different (in their  
</tt><tt>precision, range, or mantissa, i.e., according to the IEEE standard)  
</tt><tt>and to determine whether two are the same.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>&gt;    Implementations that use binary floating point representations  
</tt><tt>of real numbers should represent x|p using a p-bit significand if  
</tt><tt>practical, or by a greater precision if a p-bit significand is not  
</tt><tt>practical, or by the largest available precision if p or more bits of  
</tt><tt>significand is not practical within the implementation.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;        Note: The precision of a significand should not be confused  
</tt><tt>with the number of bits used to represent the significand. In the  
</tt><tt>IEEE floating point standards, for example, the significand's most  
</tt><tt>significant bit is implicit in single and double precision but is  
</tt><tt>explicit in extended precision. Whether that bit is implicit or  
</tt><tt>explicit does not affect the mathematical precision. In  
</tt><tt>implementations that use binary floating point, the default precision  
</tt><tt>can be calculated by calling the following procedure:
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;
&gt;        (define (precision)
&gt;          (do ((n 0 (+ n 1))
&gt;               (x 1.0 (/ x 2.0)))
&gt;            ((= 1.0 (+ 1.0 x)) n)))
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;        Note: When the underlying floating-point representation is  
</tt><tt>IEEE double precision, the |p suffix should not be omitted for all  
</tt><tt>cases: Denormalized numbers have diminished precision, and therefore  
</tt><tt>should carry a |p suffix with the actual width of the signficand.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>It seems ironic to me that this program itself assumes generic  
</tt><tt>arithmetic.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>It is not clear to me how, under this proposal, a Scheme will  
</tt><tt>implement floating-point arithmetic with more than one precision.   
</tt><tt>This is an important part of some numerical algorithms (iterative  
</tt><tt>refinement in solving linear systems, for example).
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>The first paragraph seems to make the |p notation meaningless; it  
</tt><tt>seems to specify nothing about the relationship between p and the  
</tt><tt>precision of the resulting flonum.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>&gt;     Implementations are not required to use floating-point  
</tt><tt>representations, but every implementation is required to designate a  
</tt><tt>subset of its inexact reals as flonums, and to convert certain  
</tt><tt>external representations into flonums.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>What does this mean?  In particular, can this subset be empty?  Is  
</tt><tt>that what &quot;Implementations are not required to use floating-point  
</tt><tt>representations&quot; means?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>&gt;     If a &lt;decimal 10&gt; does not contain a non-empty &lt;mantissa  
</tt><tt>width&gt;  and does not contain one of the exponent markers s, f, d, or  
</tt><tt>l, but does contain a decimal point or the exponent marker e, then it  
</tt><tt>is an external representation for a flonum. Furthermore inf.0, +inf. 
</tt><tt>0, -inf.0, nan.0, +nan.0, and -nan.0 are external representations for  
</tt><tt>flonums. Some or all of the other external representations for  
</tt><tt>inexact reals may also represent flonums, but that is not required by  
</tt><tt>this SRFI.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;    If a &lt;decimal 10&gt; contains a non-empty &lt;mantissa width&gt; or one  
</tt><tt>of the exponent markers s, f, d, or l, then it represents an inexact  
</tt><tt>number, but does not necessarily represent a flonum.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Wow; what does this mean?  The difference between flonums and  
</tt><tt>inexacts is confusing to me.  (Sorry for &quot;surfer dude&quot; mode here.)
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

&gt;    Safe and Unsafe Mode

</pre><tt>&gt;    This SRFI allows a Scheme implementation to run code in one of  
</tt><tt>two global modes: &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;unsafe&quot; mode. These affect the fixnum  
</tt><tt>and the flonum operations. In safe mode, these operations must check  
</tt><tt>that their arguments are actually fixnums or flonums respectively, or  
</tt><tt>perform possible additional checking as required by the  
</tt><tt>specifications of the operations. In unsafe mode, these operations  
</tt><tt>must provide no such checking. This distinction allows an  
</tt><tt>implementation to generate efficient numerical code at the cost of  
</tt><tt>avoiding run-time checking. The R6RS should require a Scheme  
</tt><tt>implementation to provide the safe mode.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I presume a Scheme &quot;implementation&quot; may include a compiler.  I can't  
</tt><tt>imagine that the requirement that &quot;In unsafe mode, these operations  
</tt><tt>must provide no such checking&quot; means that a compiler cannot use  
</tt><tt>dataflow and control flow information to signal an error in code,  
</tt><tt>rather than compiling it to nonsense and deliberately crashing a  
</tt><tt>program.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


&gt;    Equivalence of Objects
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;    The R6RS specification of eqv? for numbers should be changed as  
</tt><tt>follows.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;
&gt;    The eqv? procedure returns #t if:
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;        * obj1 and obj2 are both exact numbers, and are numerically  
</tt><tt>equal (see =, section see section 6.2 Numbers).
</tt><tt>&gt;        * obj1 and obj2 are both inexact numbers, are numerically  
</tt><tt>equal (see =, section see section 6.2 Numbers), and yield the same  
</tt><tt>results (in the sense of eqv?) when passed as arguments to any other  
</tt><tt>procedure that can be defined as a finite composition of Scheme's  
</tt><tt>standard arithmetic procedures.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;
&gt;    The eqv? procedure returns #f if:
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;        * one of obj1 and obj2 is an exact number but the other is  
</tt><tt>an inexact number.
</tt><tt>&gt;        * obj1 and obj2 are numbers for which the = procedure  
</tt><tt>returns #f.
</tt><tt>&gt;        * obj1 and obj2 yield different results (in the sense of  
</tt><tt>eqv?) when passed as arguments to any other procedure that can be  
</tt><tt>defined as a finite composition of Scheme's standard arithmetic  
</tt><tt>procedures.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>First, I presume that &quot;, or&quot; should be added to the end of the first  
</tt><tt>item of the first list and to the ends of the first and second items  
</tt><tt>of the second list.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>OK, I just went through the whole document and checked for every  
</tt><tt>instance of = and could not find out whether
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

(let ((x (/ 0. 0.)))
  (= x x))

</pre><tt>returns #t or #f.  It is not useful for it to return #t if IEEE  
</tt><tt>arithmetic is the underlying inexact representation and &quot;=&quot; means  
</tt><tt>&quot;IEEE arithmetic =&quot;.  So a definition of eqv? in terms of = seems  
</tt><tt>incomplete.  (Or does = mean fl= here?)
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>The definition of eqv? is recursive for inexact numbers, and I don't  
</tt><tt>see where the recursion is based.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>If we're going to go to all this trouble to insert flonums (and I  
</tt><tt>presume the main motivation is to have IEEE flonums) into Scheme, we  
</tt><tt>should add the inquiry functions of the IEEE standard (which I can't  
</tt><tt>look up at the moment, because it's not online) that return various  
</tt><tt>properties of the part of an IEEE flonum.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

&gt;    Numerical Type Predicates
&gt;    ...
</pre><tt>&gt;    Note: The behavior of these type predicates on inexact numbers  
</tt><tt>is unreliable, because any inaccuracy may affect the result.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Couldy you explain this statement?  Or give an example?

&gt;    Integer Division
&gt;    ...

Why div+mod for reals and quotient+remainder for exact integers?

</pre><tt>I'm losing it a bit; are the procedures in this section defined for  
</tt><tt>inexact numbers?  If so, then the requirement for div+mod that
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

x1 = nd * x2 + xm.

</pre><tt>may not be realizable due to precision issues; perhaps a proof is  
</tt><tt>needed here?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>The requirement that the sign of the second argument acts as a  
</tt><tt>selector to decide what function div+mod computes seems to give extra  
</tt><tt>meaning to (negate y) that should not be there.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

&gt;    Fixnums
&gt;    ...
</pre><tt>&gt;    Every implementation must define its fixnum range as a closed  
</tt><tt>interval [lo, hi] such that lo and hi are (mathematical) integers  
</tt><tt>with lo &lt;= 0 &lt; 1 &lt;= hi. Every mathematical integer within an  
</tt><tt>implementation's fixnum range must correspond to an exact integer  
</tt><tt>that is representable within the implementation. The fixnum  
</tt><tt>operations of an implementation will perform arithmetic modulo hi-lo+1.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>In mathematics, &quot;arithmetic modulo hi-lo+1&quot; means that results go  
</tt><tt>from 0 to hi-lo; I can't imagine that this is what is wanted here.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>As a practical matter, signed integer arithmetic on all modern  
</tt><tt>processors wraps, so that
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

hardware-signed-+ (2^31-1) 1  =&gt; - 2^31,

</pre><tt>yet the C standard says that such behavior is undefined.  The C  
</tt><tt>standard does require that *unsigned* arithmetic wraps
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

hardware-unsigned-+ (2^32-1) 1 =&gt; 0

</pre><tt>which is probably the reason why hardware signed arithemtic wraps the  
</tt><tt>way it does (so the processor can use a single + operation for both  
</tt><tt>signed and unsigned arithmetic).
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>&gt;    &lt;definition of many operations that naturally can take multiple  
</tt><tt>arguments to take only two arguments&gt;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Let's let the interpreter or compiler worry about doing the folding  
</tt><tt>of these operations; I don't see any reason to require the programmer  
</tt><tt>to do it by hand.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

&gt;    library procedure: fxabs fx

</pre><tt>&gt;    This procedure returns `(fx- 0 fx)' if fx is negative, fx  
</tt><tt>otherwise.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

So, do you want

(fxabs least-fixnum)  ==&gt; least-fixnum

which is what this specifies?

&gt;    procedure: fxdiv+mod fx1 fx2
&gt;    library procedure: fxdiv fx1 fx2
&gt;    library procedure: fxmod fx1 fx2
&gt;    library procedure: fxquotient fx1 fx2
&gt;    library procedure: fxmodulo+remainder fx1 fx2
&gt;    library procedure: fxmodulo fx1 fx2
&gt;    library procedure: fxremainder fx1 fx2
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;    These procedures implement number-theoretic integer division  
</tt><tt>modulo hi-lo+1. See the section on Integer Division.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>This seems to be a laundry list of ad-hoc, incompletely specified  
</tt><tt>procedures.  I really don't know what you mean by these.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

&gt;    procedure: fxbitwise-not fx

</pre><tt>&gt;    Returns the fixnum which is the one's-complement of its  
</tt><tt>argument. congruent mod hi-lo+1.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I believe it should be &quot;ones-complement&quot; and that the &quot;congruent mod  
</tt><tt>hi-lo+1&quot; is unnecessary.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

&gt;    procedure: fxarithmetic-shift fx1 fx2

</pre><tt>&gt;    This procedure conceptually shifts the two's complement  
</tt><tt>representation of fx1 fx2 bits left when fx2 &gt; 0, and -fx2 bits right  
</tt><tt>when fx2 &lt; 0, extending the sign. (It returns fx1 when fx2 = 0.) It  
</tt><tt>returns the result of that shift congruent mod hi-lo+1.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Do you mean &quot;(eq? fx1 (fxarithmetic-shift fx1 0))&quot;?

&gt;    procedure: fl= fl1 fl2
&gt;    procedure: fl&lt; fl1 fl2
&gt;    procedure: fl&lt;= fl1 fl2
&gt;    procedure: fl&gt; fl1 fl2
&gt;    procedure: fl&gt;= fl1 fl2
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;    These procedures return #t if their arguments are  
</tt><tt>(respectively): equal, monotonically increasing, monotonically  
</tt><tt>decreasing, monotonically nondecreasing, or monotonically  
</tt><tt>nonincreasing, #f otherwise. These predicates are required to be  
</tt><tt>transitive.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;
&gt;    (fl= +inf.0 +inf.0)           ==&gt;  #t
&gt;    (fl= -inf.0 +inf.0)           ==&gt;  #f
&gt;    (fl= -inf.0 -inf.0)           ==&gt;  #t
&gt;    (fl= 0.0 -0.0)                ==&gt;  unspecified
&gt;    (fl&lt; 0.0 -0.0)                ==&gt;  unspecified
&gt;    (fl= +nan.0 fl)               ==&gt;  unspecified
&gt;    (fl= +nan.0 fl)               ==&gt;  unspecified
&gt;    (fl&lt; +nan.0 fl)               ==&gt;  unspecified
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;    The following behavior is strongly recommended but not required  
</tt><tt>by R6RS:
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;    (fl= 0.0 -0.0)                 ==&gt;  #t
&gt;    (fl&lt; -0.0 0.0)                 ==&gt;  #f
&gt;    (fl= +nan.0 +nan.0)            ==&gt;  #f
&gt;
&gt;    procedure: flinteger? fl
&gt;    procedure: flzero? fl
&gt;    procedure: flpositive? fl
&gt;    procedure: flnegative? fl
&gt;    procedure: flodd? ifl
&gt;    procedure: fleven? ifl
&gt;    procedure: flnan? fl

</pre><tt>&gt;    These numerical predicates test a flonum for a particular  
</tt><tt>property, returning #t or #f. Flinteger? tests it if the number is an  
</tt><tt>integer, flzero? tests if it is fl= to zero, flpositive? tests if it  
</tt><tt>is greater than zero, flnegative? tests if it is less than zero,  
</tt><tt>flodd? tests if it is odd, fleven? tests if it is even, flnan? tests  
</tt><tt>if it is a NaN.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;
&gt;    (flnegative? -0.0) ==&gt; #f
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;    Note: `(flnegative? -0.0)' must return #f, else it would lose  
</tt><tt>the correspondence with (fl&lt; -0.0 0.0), which is #f according to the  
</tt><tt>IEEE standards.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;
&gt;    procedure: flmax fl1 fl2
&gt;    procedure: flmin fl1 fl2
&gt;
&gt;    These procedures return the maximum or minimum of their arguments.
&gt;
&gt;    procedure: fl+ fl1 fl2
procedure: fl- fl1 fl2
&gt;    procedure: fl* fl1 fl2
procedure: fl/ fl1 fl2
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;    These procedures return the flonum sum, difference, product, or  
</tt><tt>quotient of their flonum arguments. In general, they should return  
</tt><tt>the flonum that best approximates the mathematical sum, difference,  
</tt><tt>or quotient of their arguments. (For implementations that represent  
</tt><tt>flonums as IEEE binary floating point numbers, the meaning of &quot;best&quot;  
</tt><tt>is reasonably well-defined by the IEEE standards.)
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;    For undefined quotients, fl/ behaves as specified by the IEEE  
</tt><tt>standards:
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;
&gt;    (fl/ 1.0 0.0)  ==&gt; +inf.0
&gt;    (fl/ -1.0 0.0) ==&gt; -inf.0
&gt;    (fl/ 0.0 0.0)  ==&gt; +nan.0

</pre><tt>I realize that &quot;A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little  
</tt><tt>minds&quot;, but why in heaven's name do you justify some requirement by  
</tt><tt>saying &quot;we must follow IEEE arithmetic&quot; and at the same time totally  
</tt><tt>disregard other IEEE arithmetic requirments?  Either implement the  
</tt><tt>IEEE spec for floating point arithmetic in Scheme flonum arithmetic  
</tt><tt>or forget it.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

&gt;    library procedure: flnumerator fl
&gt;    library procedure: fldenominator fl
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;    These procedures return the numerator or denominator of their  
</tt><tt>argument as a flonum; the result is computed as if the argument was  
</tt><tt>represented as a fraction in lowest terms. The denominator is always  
</tt><tt>positive. The denominator of 0 is defined to be 1.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;
&gt;    (flnumerator +inf.0)           ==&gt;  +inf.0
&gt;    (flnumerator -inf.0)           ==&gt;  -inf.0
&gt;    (fldenominator +inf.0)         ==&gt;  1.0
&gt;    (fldenominator -inf.0)         ==&gt;  1.0
&gt;    (flnumerator 0.75)             ==&gt;  3.0 ; example
&gt;    (fldenominator 0.75)           ==&gt;  4.0 ; example
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;    The following behavior is strongly recommended but not required  
</tt><tt>by R6RS:
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
&gt;
&gt;    (flnumerator -0.0)             ==&gt; -0.0

</pre><tt>If +inf.0 and +nan.o are not rational, I don't think it is reasonable  
</tt><tt>for them to be in the domain of flnumerator and fldenominator.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

&gt;    procedure: flsqrt fl
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;    Returns the principal square root of z. For a negative  
</tt><tt>argument, the result may be +nan.0, or may be some meaningless  
</tt><tt>flonum. With flexp and fllog defined as above, the value of `(flsqrt  
</tt><tt>fl)' is defined as `(flexp (fl/ (fllog fl) 2.0))'.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Aren't the last two statements contradictory?

</pre><tt>As a general question---why define the flonum versions of the  
</tt><tt>elementary functions to possibly return complex arguments rather than  
</tt><tt>to have restricted ranges or to return NaNs for arguments that would  
</tt><tt>not give a real result?  If the goal of adding flonum arithmetic is  
</tt><tt>speed, why define these functions in such a way that the built-in  
</tt><tt>hardware or OS runtime library routines cannot be used directly?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

&gt;    procedure: flexpt fl1 fl2
&gt;
&gt;    Returns fl1 raised to the power fl2. For nonzero fl1
&gt;
&gt;    fl1^fl2 = e^(z2 log z1)
&gt;
</pre><tt>&gt;    0^fl is 1 if z = 0, and 0 if fl is positive. Otherwise, the  
</tt><tt>result may be +nan.0, or may be some meaningless flonum.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

I take it z2 should be fl2 and z1 should be fl1, and z should be f1.

Does the &quot;0&quot; here mean &quot;0.0&quot;?   Does the &quot;1&quot; here refer to &quot;1.0&quot;?

(Similar questions arise for insqrt.)

Enough for now.

The paper

</pre><tt>[Egner et al. 2004]  Sebastian Egner, Richard Kelsey, Michael  
</tt><tt>Sperber. Cleaning up the tower: Numbers in Scheme. In Proceedings of  
</tt><tt>the Fifth ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Scheme and Functional Programming,   
</tt><tt>pages 109--120, September 22, 2004, Snowbird, Utah. Technical report  
</tt><tt>TR600, Computer Science Department, Indiana University
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>is cited as justification for several parts of this proposal.   
</tt><tt>Unfortunately, I believe this paper to be seriously flawed.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I'm bringing this up for the following reason:  I don't believe that  
</tt><tt>this paper can be used, by itself, as justification for any aspect of  
</tt><tt>this proposal.  It may be used as an *argument* for certain aspects  
</tt><tt>of the proposal, but as there has been no general discussion of the  
</tt><tt>merits of the paper, either in this forum or in others, I don't  
</tt><tt>believe that it can be used as &quot;settled decisions&quot;.  Thus, if the  
</tt><tt>authors of this SRFI wish to use arguments from that paper as  
</tt><tt>justification for certain aspects of *this* proposal, they should  
</tt><tt>repeat those arguments here for them to be discussed and debated as  
</tt><tt>usual.
