<pre>&gt; SRFI-40 is deprecated due to a memory leak.  Please port SRFI-41 instead,
&gt; and adapt any code that uses SRFI-40 to the new interface.

Did you, during the design of srfi-41, consider the existance of the
stream-ext library, which implements a lot of stream functions on top
of srfi-40?

<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://chicken.wiki.br/eggref/3/stream-ext">http://chicken.wiki.br/eggref/3/stream-ext</a>

It's first version was released a long time before srfi-41 and only
small changes have been made since then.  The naming conventions and
the semantics match those of srfi-1 as close as possible, to make
things as consistent as possible.

I've used the stream-ext library in many applications that represent
strings as streams of characters throughout.  The largest of these is
probably Svnwiki.

I'm worried about the incompatibilities I see between stream-ext and
srfi-41.  My concerns are the following:

1. srfi-41 provides a very small subset of the functionality that I
think that any program that uses streams significantly will need.  As
such, I think it fails significantly at providing &quot;syntax derived from
those primitives that permits convenient expression of stream
operations&quot;.  Most of the functions I list below can be implemented in
a portable manner, as stream-ext does.  To be fair, srfi-41 does seem
to provide some functions that stream-ext does not.

2. More importantly (the previous concern can be solved with an
additional library), a small portion of the interface exported by
srfi-41 differs from that in the stream-ext library.  I provide some
cases below and explain why I believe the semantics from stream-ext
are slightly preferable, mostly because of consistency with the srfi-1
list-based counterparts.  I quite like the interface of srfi-1 and I
find that, by providing inconsistent counterparts, srfi-41 is making
it slightly harder to use streams than stream-ext.

I may be the person who has written the most Scheme code using srfi-40
streams.  I've put special care into the design of the interface of
the stream-ext library.  This interest I have in using streams in
Scheme makes the fact that srfi-41 offers an inferior interface rather
frustrating for me.

Now onto the differences and similarities:

The following is a list of symbols provided by stream-ext and srfi-41
with apparently the exact same semantics:

  list-&gt;stream
  stream-ref
  stream-length
  stream-append
  stream-take-while
  stream-drop-while

The following is a list of symbols available in stream-ext but not in
srfi-41, which I believe most software using streams would benefit
from:

  stream-xcons
  stream-cons*
  stream-tabulate
  stream-iota
  make-infinite-stream

    I think these should be included as counterparts to the srfi-1
    versions for lists.  The make-infinite-stream should probably be
    added (see stream-ext's make-stream, discussed bellow).

  stream-&gt;string
  string-&gt;stream
  stream-downcase, stream-upcase
  stream-lines
  stream-unlines

    I think these should be included: if one does include
    port-&gt;stream, encouraging the use of streams of characters to
    represent ports/streams, why not go the extra mile of simplifying
    conversion to and from strings and handling of streams of
    characters?

  stream-&gt;vector
  vector-&gt;stream
  number-&gt;stream
  stream-&gt;number
  stream-&gt;symbol
  symbol-&gt;stream

    And if we include the stream-&gt;string and string-&gt;stream symbols,
    encouraging the programmer to use streams throughout his program
    to represent strings, these should probably also be included,
    specially the vector ones.  I don't think we should force all
    programs that use streams to define this compositions directly.

  iterator-&gt;stream

    This is a fundamental block for turning iterators into streams.
    I've found it extremely useful in my programs that use streams.
    For example, list-&gt;stream can be trivially implemented as:

      (define (list-&gt;stream l)
        (iterator-&gt;stream
          (lambda (return stop)
            (for-each return l))))

    Among *many* other things, this makes it trivial to do things like
    'with-output-to-stream', given the right support from the
    implementation (for creating special ports).  Also,
    iterator-&gt;stream does not depend on anything non-portable, simply
    on call/cc.

  write-stream

    The counter-part to port-&gt;stream.  Most of my programs have a lot
    of functions that generate streams (see for example my html-stream
    library).  A lot of these will be wrapped in a simple call to
    write-stream, to output these to the right port.  I think it
    should be included in a general purpose streams library.

  stream=
  stream-prefix=
  stream&gt;, stream&lt;
  stream-caar ... stream-cddddr
  stream-first ... stream-tenth
  stream-intersperse
  stream-split
  stream-last
  stream-last-n
  stream-butlast
  stream-butlast-n
  stream-length&gt;=
  stream-count
  stream-partition
  stream-remove
  stream-sort
  stream-find
  stream-find-tail
  stream-any
  stream-every

    I'm using all these quite often.  I feel all of them deserve
    inclussion in a general purpose for construction of streams.  I
    think this is obvious enough that I won't waste my time justifying
    it.  If you think a given one of these should not be included, ask
    me and I'll explain why I think it should.

    I find it a bit surprising that stream-partition, stream-remove,
    stream-find and stream-sort were not included in the library, even
    though they were considered general enough that they were defined
    as examples (though stream-sort is implemented using merge-sort).

  with-output-to-stream

    Very convenient for turning code that generates output to its
    current-output-port into code that builds a (lazy, obviously)
    stream.  However, I suppose this can't be implemented in a
    portable manner. :-/

  with-input-from-stream

    The rationale is very similar to that of with-output-to-stream.
    However, I've found this procedure a bit less useful than the
    other.

The following is a list of symbols provided by stream-ext with
semantics incompatible with those of srfi-41.  I believe the
definition in stream-ext is more adequate for the reasons I explain.

  make-stream

    stream-ext's definition matches the counterpart from srfi-1's
    make-list.  srfi-41 defines this but, fortunately, does not export
    it.

  stream-&gt;list
  
    I don't like the idea of the optional number-of-elements
    arguments.  This should simply work only on finite streams (and
    one should use stream-take for infinite streams).  I think
    stream-ext's definition is more adequate as it more commonly
    reflects the expectation from the programmer (of just converting a
    stream to its corresponding list); taking the head of the list
    should not be done by this function.  I also tend to dislike
    optional parameters preceeding mandatory parameters.

  port-&gt;stream

    The interface described in srfi-41 is a subset of that in
    stream-ext: stream-ext adds two optional parameters that make this
    procedure a lot more flexible/usable, without any disadvantages.

  stream-take, stream-take-safe
  stream-drop, stream-drop-safe

    These are *almost* compatible.  The only difference is that, in
    consistence with srfi-1, I've decided to make it an error to take
    more elements than the stream has.  srfi-41, instead, has decided
    to not make it an error.  I prefer the stream-ext behavior simply
    for being consistent with what the srfi-1 counterparts do.  I want
    to make the streams and lists libraries as compatible as possible.

  stream-concatenate

    srfi-41 decided to call this stream-concat, which is inconsistent
    with srfi-1.  I prefer stream-ext's consistent naming convention.

  stream-reverse

    This is *almost* compatible, but stream-ext allows the caller to
    pass a list to be appended to the result, which I think makes the
    procedure slightly more useful.

The following are other symbols in stream-ext that I haven't had time
to compare with those in srfi-41:

  stream-fold
  stream-fold-right
  stream-fold-right-delay
  stream-span, stream-break
  stream-index
  stream-member, stream-memq, stream-memv
  stream-format
  stream-delete
  stream-delete-duplicates

I suspect the fold procedures provided by stream-ext are far more
usable than those in srfi-41, but, as I said, I haven't had time to
compare them.

The following are symbols in srfi-41 and not in srfi-40 that I haven't
had time to compare with those in stream-ext:

  stream-lambda
  define-stream
  stream-constant
  stream-fold
  stream-from
  stream-iterate
  stream-let
  stream-match
  stream-of
  stream-range
  stream-scan
  stream-unfold
  stream-unfolds
  stream-zip

Thanks.

Alejo.
