 &gt; The short form is wonderful; we should keep it just as it is.
 &gt; 
 &gt; (1) It is not possible to make the relation of long form to short
 &gt; form for |define-syntax| exactly parallel to that for |define|
 &gt; without major changes to the language.  Given that they must be
 &gt; different, it is less likely to cause confusion if the difference
 &gt; is large.
 &gt; 
 &gt; (2) It is a long tradition that a macro has one argument which is
 &gt; bound to the entire form of the macro call.  I think that both
 &gt; LISP 1.5 and Common Lisp do it that way.
 
 Thank you - more good reasons supporting the current choice.  
  
 &gt; The appendix of R4RS says that it has been suggested (it doesn't
 &gt; say by whom) that #'&lt;datum&gt; and #`&lt;datum&gt; would be felicitous
 &gt; abbreviations for (syntax &lt;datum&gt;) and (quasisyntax &lt;datum&gt;).
 &gt; Could this be added to the SRFI?
 
 I will add that as a recommendation in the next revision.
 
 &gt; Since |syntax| is already analogous to |quote|, is |syntax-quote|
 &gt; really the right name for the third way?  If I understood it
 &gt; better, I might be able to name it better.  How about
 &gt; |syntax-reuse|?
 
 Good point.  Another possibility could be |syntax-verbatim|.  
 I'm also considering dropping this one, since it can be defined as a macro
 (although admittedly a rather ugly macro involving a compile-time
 data structure - hmm).     
 
 &gt; As a stylistic matter, I think it would be better to remove uses
 &gt; of |syntax-case| and |with-syntax| from the examples, except
 &gt; where comparison with |syntax-case| is the point of the example.
 
 &gt; In particular, the example given under the description of
 &gt; |syntax-quote| is confusing because it requires a rather deep
 &gt; understanding of |syntax-case| in order to follow.  A better
 &gt; example would be built out of the the forms defined by the
 &gt; SRFI only.  I bet it would actually come out shorter that
 &gt; way, but I won't venture to try to make the example this
 &gt; close to midnight.  It would also help to have two examples,
 &gt; identical except that one uses |syntax| and the other
 &gt; uses |syntax-quote| with different results.
 
 Since |syntax-case| is included in the new revision,
 it is probably okay to use it in examples where the pattern
 matching makes things clearer.  Where it doesn't, as in the |syntax-quote|
 example you raise, I'll work on rewriting them.    
 
 By the way, my justification for including the |syntax-case| form, even 
 though it is not a primitive, has not been well documented yet.  
 So here goes:  
 
   * I am specifying an improvement in the semantics of syntax-case
     for better hygiene.
     
   * A proposal that does not come with some form of pattern matching 
     won't be regarded as usable by many Schemers.  
   
   * For R5RS compatibility, we need to provide syntax-rules.  
     Syntax-case implies syntax-rules, and since the implementation 
     of syntax-case is only a few lines longer than that of syntax-rules,
     the implementation cost of including syntax-case is negligible.   

 &gt; The link to Andrew Wright's pattern matcher
 &gt;  <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://download.plt-scheme.org/.../match.ss">http://download.plt-scheme.org/.../match.ss</a>
 &gt; at the end of kffd-match-tut.htm seems to be broken.
 
 Thank you - I removed it.  
 
 Cheers
 Andre
