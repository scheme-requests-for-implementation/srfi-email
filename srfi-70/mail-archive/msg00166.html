After two failed attempts, I will concede that my command of CS is
inadequate to produce proofs about Scheme.  My July 21 statement was
brazen; apologies to everyone for the flamage.

A Scheme implementation in which inexact reals are represented by
unbounded integer ratios (and where complex inexacts are pairs of
unbounded integer ratios) is an example where each point is its entire
neighborhood.

Alex Shinn devised a clever way to define real infinities for a
similar system:

  Infinity in this case could be defined as the range of all real
  numbers greater than the largest possible BigFloat using all of
  memory for the exponent.

But if we consider memory limitations for this system, then there are
many mathematical numbers between any two representable inexacts whose
storage requirements are too large to be represented on a particular
physical computer.  Ideally, on input or in the course of calculation,
those mathematical numbers would be rounded to the closest inexacts
with smaller representations.  So even here, I think that each inexact
number corresponds to a mathematical neighborhood containing more than
one point.

			      -=-=-=-=-

The motivation for the inexact neighborhoods was to unify the
interpretation of inexact numbers with infinities; making both
correspond to non-singular simply-connected neighborhoods.  It was a
nice idea; but it is not indispensable.

Mention of neighborhoods in SRFI-70 is localized to the &quot;6.2.2x
Inexactness&quot; section.  If singular neighborhoods can't be ruled out,
then I will change it.

So, does R5RS permit an inexact number which only one mathematical
number rounds to?
