&gt;&gt; I pre-apologize if this is a dumb question, but as it seems that
&gt;&gt; exact values are only interesting for integer ratios, which
&gt;&gt; correspondingly seem reasonable to expect to have some practical
&gt;&gt; limited representational precision, therefore also imply the
&gt;&gt; necessity to depict an over/underflowed value (i.e. +/- infinity and
&gt;&gt; reciprocals); why is it perceived as necessary and/or appropriate to
&gt;&gt; presume it's the responsibility of the programmer to limit computed
&gt;&gt; values to reasonable precision rational values as opposed to
&gt;&gt; possibly more simply defining that exacts are merely only more exact
&gt;&gt; than inexacts to some definable precision?  As beyond academic
&gt;&gt; definition of exact, pretending that an arbitrary exact
&gt;&gt; implementation supports infinitely exact computations seems both
&gt;&gt; naive and impractical?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, exact answers are just that -- exact.  That's all it means,
&gt; really; the computer is telling you whether this number is *exactly*
&gt; right, not making any statements about how it's represented.  If it
&gt; wasn't able to produce an exact answer due to the numeric
&gt; representation being limited to some particular precision where the
&gt; exact answer requires more precision to express, then usually I want
&gt; at least an inexact answer.
&gt; 
&gt; It is not unreasonable for an implementation to limit the dynamic
&gt; range or precision of its numbers.  If the implementation has, then
&gt; rather than return an exact number outside the dynamic range, we must
&gt; either report a violation of an implementation restriction, or return
&gt; an inexact number within the dynamic range. If the implementation has
&gt; not imposed such a limit, then inevitably the hardware does anyway.
&gt; In that case we must either return an inexact number, or report an out
&gt; of memory error.
&gt; 
&gt; Typically the dynamic range or precision of inexact numbers is much
&gt; less than that of exact numbers.  But how much less and in what ways
&gt; is an interesting question in dialect design.  My own opinion is that
&gt; for consistent mathematics, exact and inexact numbers should have
&gt; similar dynamic ranges - meaning more limited &quot;exact&quot; representations
&gt; than most implementors use and greatly extended &quot;inexact&quot;
&gt; representations of about the same size as the &quot;exact&quot; representations.
&gt; But most people feel that &quot;inexact&quot; should be a codeword for
&gt; &quot;Hardware-supported floating-point format,&quot; and for some calculations
&gt; and applications, that's actually better.
&gt; 
&gt; There's a lot of room for interpretation in this part of the standard.
&gt; There's also a lot of room for extensions and variations in behavior.
&gt; It's hard to say what is &quot;The Right Thing,&quot; really - and it frequently
&gt; depends on your particular application.

- Thanks, I guess my point/question was predominantly related to the
observation that there seems often little need for truly &quot;exact&quot; values
beyond theoretical geometry and/or combinatorial mathematics, which often
themselves only require a determinable finite precision; while
simultaneously observing there's often broader need for more precise
potentially &quot;inexact&quot; values than typically supported by double precision
floating point implementations; so it just seemed that in practice that it
may be more useful to define that &quot;exact&quot; values need only be as precise as
necessary to support the exact representation of the integer values bounded
by the dynamic range of the implementation's &quot;inexact&quot; implementation, and
their corresponding reciprocal values in practice (as you've implied);
thereby both providing a likely reasonably efficient &quot;inexact&quot; (aka double)
and a likely reasonably precise corresponding &quot;exact&quot; representation,
thereby seemingly satisfying a large majority of both theoretical and
computational mathematical application requirements, without needing to
place the burden on the programmer to manually explicitly limit the
precision of &quot;exact&quot; values which exceed the typical precision of an
&quot;inexact&quot; representation in order to prevent the potentially catastrophic
consequences of specifying a &quot;exact&quot; calculation which may either exhaust
the practical resources available to the program, or potentially equally
catastrophic consequences of limiting the precision of a calculation to the
likely substantially less precise &quot;inexact&quot; floating point implementation.

(as then those few applications which may need greater precision than
warranted by an &quot;exact&quot; implementation, may implement it as an application
specific library package on top of the implementation's native &quot;exact&quot;
implementation, as just a though?)
