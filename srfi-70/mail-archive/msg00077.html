 | 
 | I have four things to say.
 | 
 | 1.  Defining a distinct external syntax for every NaN, or providing
 | some other means for programs to create specific NaNs, would
 | interfere with a representation that is likely to be of great
 | importance on 64-bit machines.
 | 
 | With regard to the first point, one of the most attractive 64-bit
 | representations is to represent all non-NaN inexact reals in IEEE
 | double precision format, and to represent all other Scheme values
 | as NaNs.  This works because there are about 2^53 NaNs, which is
 | about 2^53 more NaNs than are needed to represent the results of
 | floating point computation.
 | 
 | Using these excess NaNs to encode all of Scheme's non-flonum values
 | is practical, and results in very efficient floating point
 | calculation.  I would oppose any proposed external syntax for NaNs
 | that might interfere with the representation of Scheme values as
 | NaNs.

SRFI-70 mandates no connection between IEEE-754 NaN and 0/0.  In fact,
(= 0/0 0/0) ==&gt; #t, while NaN != NaN in IEEE-754 arithmetic (in C).
Furthermore, SRFI-70 0/0 is a single number (which is not complex).
And 0/0 is optional in SRFI-70.

So SRFI-70 is no threat to using 2^53 NaNs for any purpose.

 | 2.  The proposed 1/0 and -1/0 syntax for infinities has two related
 | problems: it looks like these things are exact, and allowing this
 | syntax will require a more complicated rule for deciding whether a
 | numeric literal is exact or inexact.

One of the notations being floated is #i1/0 and #i-1/0 (and #i0/0).
This notation looks inexact; and requires no rule complications.
Does that assuage your concerns?

 | 3.  The +inf.0 and -inf.0 syntax is already used by several
 | implementations, which agreed to standardize upon it several years
 | ago, before the SRFI process began.  Th +inf.0 and -inf.0 syntaxes
 | (and +nan.0) also appear within The Revised R6RS Status Report of
 | October 2004, which is online at www.schemers.org.

 | With regard to 2 and 3, I think SRFIs and other standardization
 | processes should attempt to build on past standardization;
 | otherwise we'll just be going around in circles.  The proposed 1/0
 | and -1/0 syntax is contrary to the R5RS rule for determining
 | whether an external representation names an exact or inexact
 | number.  It is also contrary to the informal standard that several
 | major implementations have already agreed upon and have used for
 | several years.  Finally, it is contrary to the syntax being
 | considered by the R6RS editors.  Their progress report of October
 | 2004 listed +inf.0 and -inf.0 among the things that are &quot;probably
 | not terribly controversial&quot;.

On June 28, 2003 I posted to rrrs-authors@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx a survey
&lt;<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~jaffer/III/RAWI">http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~jaffer/III/RAWI</a>&gt; of infinity behaviors
and notations in Kawa-1.7, SCM-5d8, Guile-1.3.4, Bigloo-2.5c,
glibc-2.2, Elk-3.0, Gambit-3.0, Mz-Scheme-202, MIT-Scheme-7.8, and
Scheme-48-0.57.  At that time, there was no notation common to more
than one Scheme implementation.  That it is &quot;not terribly
controversial&quot; could only be arrived at by ignoring most
Scheme implementations.

Being an author of SCM, and having posted an article on this topic to
rrrs-authors@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, I am mystified by a standardization
process which not only doesn't include interested implementors, it
doesn't even notify them &quot;several years&quot; after the fact!  Am I wasting
my time tendering SRFIs in hopes of participating in the development
of R6RS?

As for the relative merits of notations, 1/0 is very evocative for
infinity.  While &quot;finit&quot; is a Latin root, &quot;infinit&quot; is a Middle
English derivation.  Thus &quot;inf&quot; will be not be nearly as evocative for
most people.  Numerical data written by Scheme programs will be seen
by people who have never read a Scheme Report.  Seeing 1/0 or -1/0,
many will intuit that the calculation reached an exceptional value.

&quot;Nan&quot; as a numerical notation is obscure, even to English speakers.
It is an acronym for not-a-number, which isn't the case for SRFI-70
#i0/0; (number? #i0/0) ==&gt; #t.

There is still time for R6RS to improve upon the casually adopted
&quot;standard&quot; of +inf.0.

 | 4.  So far as I can tell, the R5RS does not require
 | every number to have an external representation.

You are correct.  The type restriction implied by the `z' argument is
that only complex numbers need have external representations.

6.2.6 Numerical input and output:

 -- procedure: number-&gt;string z
 -- procedure: number-&gt;string z radix
     ... The procedure `number-&gt;string'
     takes a number and a radix and returns as a string an external
     representation of the given number in the given radix such that

     (let ((number NUMBER)
           (radix RADIX))
       (eqv? number
             (string-&gt;number (number-&gt;string number
                                             radix)
                             radix)))

     is true.  It is an error if no possible result makes this
     expression true.

1.3.3 Entry format:

  It is an error for an operation to be presented with an argument
  that it is not specified to handle.

Thus (number-&gt;string 0/0) is an error.

The equivalence of number notations between string-&gt;number,
number-&gt;string, literal constants, and read, and write was shown in
