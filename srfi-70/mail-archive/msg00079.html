&gt;I have four things to say.
&gt;
&gt;1.  Defining a distinct external syntax for every NaN,
&gt; or providing some other means for programs to create
&gt; specific NaNs, would interfere with a representation
&gt; that is likely to be of great importance on 64-bit
&gt; machines.

Good point.

&gt;2.  The proposed 1/0 and -1/0 syntax for infinities
&gt; has two related problems: it looks like these things
&gt; are exact, and allowing this syntax will require a
&gt; more complicated rule for deciding whether a numeric
&gt; literal is exact or inexact.

&gt;3.  The +inf.0 and -inf.0 syntax is already used by
&gt;several implementations, which agreed to standardize
&gt;upon it several years ago, before the SRFI process
&gt;began.  Th +inf.0 and -inf.0 syntaxes (and +nan.0)
&gt;also appear within The Revised R6RS Status Report of
&gt;October 2004, which is online at www.schemers.org.

I agree with this, by the way: I'd much rather see
+inf.0 and -inf.0 than 1/0 and -1/0.  To me the
connotations are different:  +inf.0 means &quot;numeric
overflow:&quot;  1/0 means &quot;illegal operation.&quot;  Or,
mathematically, +inf.0 seems to mean &quot;we can't tell
how big this is, and it may be infinite&quot; and 1/0
means &quot;this is, exactly and absolutely, a first-order
infinity.&quot;  I find +inf.0 and -inf.0 seem to me to
express the ideas that are more in line with the way
they are used in computer programs. Besides, they
are already used by more implementations than 1/0
and -1/0.


&gt;4.  So far as I can tell, the R5RS does not require
&gt; every number to have an external representation.

:-/  I agree with you, but this is one of the things
that I think ought to be fixed about RNRS.  In other
words, I call &quot;bug, not feature.&quot;

&gt; With regard to the first point, one of the most
&gt; attractive 64-bit representations is to represent
&gt; all non-NaN inexact reals in IEEE double precision
&gt; format, and to represent all other Scheme values as
&gt; NaNs.

&gt;  This works because there are about 2^53 NaNs,
&gt; which is about 2^53 more NaNs than are needed to
&gt; represent the results of floating point computation.

Hmm, that would work.  2^51 fixnums, 2^21 one-code
characters, #t, #f, the empty-list, the EOF object, 2^10 or
so error objects including several used as NaNs, etc, and
you've still got 2^52 codes left over for pointers to
non-immediate values, plus almost that many codes still
unused for whatever purpose.  Plus, there's no indirection
or masking required for floats, which makes float operations
fast.


&gt; With regard to 2 and 3, I think SRFIs and other
&gt; standardization processes should attempt to build on
&gt; past standardization; otherwise we'll just be going
&gt; around in circles.

This appeal to standardization efforts would work better if
the promulgators of such &quot;standards&quot; had been more diligent
about contacting the authors of other implementations and
letting them know that there was a standard, even an
informal one, in place.  As matters stand, I think +inf.0
and -inf.0 have to stand on their merits, and the fact that
there are several implementations that already use them.

At any rate, R6RS isn't going to be taking as small a detail
as a name from the SRFI's.  If anything, it will be looking
at the concept of including an infinity, period.  If it
needs a name, it will be looking to implementations, not
SRFI's. And that's as should be, I think. SRFI's don't
contribute directly to R6RS: implementations adopting SRFI's
and users creating code that takes advantage of them do.
And that's as it should be, I think.
