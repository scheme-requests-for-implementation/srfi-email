&gt;&gt; Also, my issues include SRFI-44's failure to meet the basic
&gt;&gt; requirements of a SRFI. The late date has very little to do with
&gt;&gt; that. The original proposal did not address compatibility issues, and
&gt;&gt; because of that, SRFI-44 was nearly finalized with an undocumented
&gt;&gt; incompatibility with R5R6 Scheme. It took a risk (by not documenting
&gt;&gt; compatibility issues) that would have become a major defect had a
&gt;&gt; reviewer not caught it.

Taylor Campbell wrote:
&gt; There _is_no_incompatibility_.  R5RS _does_not_specify_ what
&gt; {VECTOR,STRING}-SET! return; SRFI 44 does.  That is an _extension_
&gt; that is _compatible_.

Will you two please set your egos aside and examine facts instead of
making excuses? According to the original spec, SRFI-44 vector-set! was
not an extension. It was a linear-update function, which means that
users must rely on the return value and must not rely on side-effects to
the input vector. With the R5RS version, users must rely on the
side-effects and must not rely on the return value. The two are purely
incompatible, and yet the author claimed he was ready to finalize the
SRFI.

&gt; Before you start waving your hands (as if there hasn't been enough of
&gt; that on every side of this flame war) about module systems such as
&gt; PLT's where SRFI 44 as a module might prove to be problematic, I shall
&gt; again state that this is _not_ meant to be a library SRFI.

That part of the argument is gravy. The incompatibility with R5RS is the
meat. But the gravy is important too: If the proposal is difficult or
expensive, it won't get implemented. If it creates outright
incompatibilities with R5RS, vendors won't pick it up -- it's irrelevant
whether it's a library or a core module.

Although seriously, you two are kidding yourselves if you really think
that a collections API is not a library module. And you're doubly
kidding yourselves if a collections API is a suitable vehicle for
implementing a change in the SRFI process.

&gt; Library SRFI are 1, 13, 43, et cetera.  This is a proposal for both a
&gt; basic interface to various kinds of collections and a specification of
&gt; some way to write generic operations on generic collection types.

And that's another problem with the SRFI. It's just an interface,
without a complete implementation. Reviewers (and not just me) are still
objecting that it's not obvious how to implement parts of the interface.
When I suggested just that earlier, Scott claimed that I was insulting
implementors everywhere by claiming that it wasn't clear enough!

&gt;&gt; Likewise, SRFI-44 takes risks by not fully implementing the
&gt;&gt; interfaces that it specifies. I'm not willing to accept that risk,
&gt;&gt; especially not after the compatibility problem.

&gt; Despite the fact that there have been _plenty_ of other collections
&gt; APIs from which this SRFI defines, and _plenty_ of implementations of
&gt; them?

There have been *plenty* of other exception-handling systems in other
languages, but that didn't excuse SRFI-34 from providing a complete
implementation. You two need to demonstrate that *your* implementation
works.

&gt; What more do you want the SRFI to meet?

Actually following the basic requirements of the SRFI process would
help.

&gt; A concrete collections SRFI is a different beast.

And it would have a chance of actually being useful! Standardizing
interfaces is moderately useful, but it has little chance of succeeding
without concrete implementations and experience with it in real
projects. You've provided an &quot;outline&quot; implementation, which means that
it must meet a higher standard: The concrete implementation must be
obvious from the outline, and the rationale must be especially
compelling. Neither of those are true in this case.
