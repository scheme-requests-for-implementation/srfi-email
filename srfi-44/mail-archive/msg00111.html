&gt;&gt; Set! compatible with R5RS - The original specification for *-set! was

OK, that's fine, but then the *-set! procedure needs a different name:

1. In R5RS, *-set! is always purely mutable.
2. Vector-set! already exists with pure-mutable semantics.

&gt;&gt; *=? and &lt;=?: I added question marks for consistency with functions
&gt;&gt; like string=?. I also removed the elt= argument and changed the
&gt;&gt; definition so that it was no longer necessary. I was reluctant to
&gt;&gt; make this change, but I felt that the original version just wasn't
&gt;&gt; viable.

&gt; I don't like this at all.  Removing ELT= is removing a _lot_ of
&gt; functionality.  The reason the ? wasn't there was _because_ the
&gt; procedures were not comparable to STRING=?, CHAR=?, et cetera.

OK, I agree. How about this instead:

1. Rename the procedure to *-equal? so that you don't end up with both
   string= (SRFI-44) and string=? (R5RS). In general, it's best to avoid
   identifiers that differ by only one character.

2. For dictionaries, if elt=? is a procedure, use it to compare both
   keys and values, and if elt=? is a pair of procedures, use (car
   elt=?) to compare keys and (cdr elt=?) to compare values. For all
   other collections, use elt=? or (cdr elt=?).

(Using the dictionary's key-equivalence function wouldn't work --
consider what happens when you try to compare two dictionaries with
different KEFs.)

By the way, one of the reasons I wanted to get rid of elt=? was to make
this more convenient for higher-order functions. If somebody can come up
with a reasonable default for elt=? and a syntax for omitting it, that'd
be great. If not, we can always use (lambda a (apply *-equal? eqv? a)).

&gt; I don't understand the rationale for having ordering functions on
&gt; _collections_.  Can you explain this in more detail?  (or in any
&gt; detail at all: I can't find any)

Mainly because sets, sequences, and ordered collections all have
well-defined total ordering functions (proper subsets and
lexicographical comparisons). Also because it gives users a built-in
ordering function for creating ordered collections of collections (which
is fairly common in some programming styles).

&gt;&gt; procedure: % {key&lt;? | key=?} {val&lt;? | val=?} value ... =&gt; %
&gt;&gt; defined for: all collections

&gt; The ordering functions here sort of make sense, I guess...but I don't
&gt; like how they work with these two constructors.  It's ambiguous what
&gt; argument corresponds to what; for example, is (list = 1 2 3) a list
&gt; with = for a comparison function and (1 2 3) for contents, or a list
&gt; (#{Procedure} 1 2 3)?  (where '#{Procedure}' indicates an abstract
&gt; procedure value)

Sorry, I didn't explain the syntax. The {opt} indicates an optional part
of the interface, not an optional argument. For example:

    procedure: bag val=? value ... =&gt; bag
    procedure: dictionary key=? val=? pair ... =&gt; dictionary
    procedure: ordered-dict key&lt;? val=? pair ... =&gt; ordered-dict

The arguments aren't optional, but not all constructors use them.

&gt;&gt; procedure: *-copy * =&gt; *
&gt;&gt; defined for: all collections
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Returns a new collection of the same type as the argument with the same
&gt;&gt; contents but distinct storage. The copy is shallow; that is, it copies
&gt;&gt; values in a way that preserves object identity.

&gt; I should like a *-COPY for sequences that also accepts optional start
&gt; and end arguments.

Yes, that would be good. If provided, I'd prefer &quot;start to end-1&quot;
semantics, like C arrays and C++ iterators.

&gt;&gt; TYPE PREDICATES
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; procedure: collection? value =&gt; value
&gt;&gt; procedure: %? value =&gt; value
&gt;&gt; defined for: all collections
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Returns a true value iff the provided value supports the interface for
&gt;&gt; the type (%) named in the predicate.

&gt; Why %? and not *??

I didn't think it made a difference in this case. It's defined for all
collections, and it has &quot;isa&quot; semantics. If you think * makes more
sense, feel free to change it.

&gt;&gt; CARDINALITY OPERATORS
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; procedure: *-empty? collection =&gt; boolean

&gt; Don't forget the 'defined for: all collections' bit.

Oops, thanks.

&gt;&gt; procedure: *-size collection =&gt; exact integer
&gt;&gt; defined for: all collections
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If the collection has a concept of size, this function returns the
&gt;&gt; number of values or mappings in the collection. If it does not, #f must
&gt;&gt; be returned. If possible, this should return the number of times
&gt;&gt; collection-fold will call the fold-function before halting.

&gt; Have we decided on the issues of infiniteness and circularity yet?

I think so, but I'm not certain. We did decide that *-size was a
sufficient replacement for finite-collection?. I think we also agree
that *-size should return the number of enumerations and that a circular
data structure is not necessarily infinite, but I'm not sure.

&gt;&gt; procedure: *-equivalence-function * =&gt; procedure
&gt;&gt; defined for: bags, sets, and dictionaries
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; procedure: *-ordering-function * =&gt; procedure
&gt;&gt; defined for: ordered bags, sets, and dictionaries

&gt; Where's the rationale for defining these _and_ [the keyed versions] on
&gt; dictionaries?

To support the &quot;simple&quot; version of *=. Therefore, you can drop
dictionaries from the list if you stick with the original *= interface.

However, it just occurred to me that there's some ambiguity for
ordered-collection -- dictionaries are usually in key order, but other
collections are in value order. I think we actually need to separate
them into &quot;ordered-collection&quot; and &quot;key-ordered-collection.&quot; Otherwise,
you'll have problems with polymorphism.

&gt;&gt; procedure: *-update * position f [thunk] =&gt; *
&gt;&gt; procedure: *-update! * position f [thunk] =&gt; unspecified
&gt;&gt; defined for: sequences and ordered collections
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; procedure: *-update-key * key f [thunk] =&gt; *
&gt;&gt; procedure: *-update-key! * key f [thunk] =&gt; unspecified
&gt;&gt; defined for: sequences and ordered collections

&gt; I don't understand why you're differentiating between these two, and
&gt; why they aren't defined for dictionaries.

First, there's a typo: *-update is for sequences, *-update-key is for
dictionaries.

The reason for having two different functions is because key lookup is
*not* the same thing as indexing. I gave them similar names because
they're similar, but I didn't merge them because they're orthogonal.

Specifically, consider a dictionary that is also a sequence -- hash
tables, binary search vectors, and alists are good examples. By having
two functions, we can look up values by index or by key.

&gt;&gt; procedure: *-add-key[!] * new-key mapped-value [thunk] =&gt; *
&gt;&gt; defined for: dictionaries
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Returns a collection of the same type with the new key mapped to the
&gt;&gt; given value.

&gt; Why have *-ADD with key/value pairs _and_ this?

Syntactic sugar, mostly. Also for consistency with the other -key
functions.

&gt;&gt; procedure: *-remove-every[!] * value =&gt; * list
&gt;&gt; procedure: *-remove-each-from[!] * source-collection [thunk] =&gt; % list
&gt;&gt; procedure: *-remove-every-from[!] * source-collection [thunk] =&gt; % list
&gt;&gt; procedure: *-remove-key[!] * key [thunk] =&gt; * pair

&gt; Why differentiate between removing and removing keys?

Because they're two different operations: *-remove takes a value out of
a bag, and *-remove-key takes a key out of a dictionary. If you have a
dictionary that is also a bag, those need to be two different methods.

In other words, this is the same issue as update/update-key above.

&gt;&gt; procedure: *-remove-every-key[!] * key [thunk] =&gt; * list
&gt;&gt; procedure: *-remove-each-key-from[!] * source [thunk] =&gt; * list
&gt;&gt; procedure: *-remove-every-key-from[!] * source [thunk] =&gt; * list

&gt; Er, why all of the name changes?

Hm, thought I already explained this. I couldn't get my head around
&quot;all&quot; and &quot;any&quot; -- kept thinking that &quot;all&quot; was the one that got rid of
all the copies. I dunno whether &quot;every&quot; and &quot;each&quot; is better, but I
*strongly* dislike any &amp; all. I chose &quot;each&quot; to mimic &quot;for-each.&quot;

&gt;&gt; procedure: *-insert-right * new-value [thunk] =&gt; *
&gt;&gt; defined for: reversible sequences
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; procedure: *-delete-right * [thunk] =&gt; *
&gt;&gt; defined for: reversible sequences and reversible ordered collections

&gt; Don't you mean 'reversible _flexible_ sequences?'

The original version allowed insert-right (but not insert-left) even for
non-flexible sequences. And the definition of non-flexible (limited)
sequences does permit addition at the end for some sequences.

My assumption here would be that fixed-size sequences (and others which
do not support end-extension) would call thunk.
