In the updated srfi-58.html I sent to the editor I have eliminated the
#Axxx syntax.  The rank digit(s) will be required.

 | &gt;  | So, for example, the two-by-two array of unsigned 16-bit integers from

 | &gt;  | General object arrays' types would be OBJECT (so #(FOO 1 #T ())
 | &gt;  | could also be written #,(ARRAY OBJECT FOO 1 #T ())) and character
 | &gt;  | arrays' types would be CHAR (so &quot;foo&quot; could alternatively be
 | &gt;  | written #,(ARRAY CHAR #\f #\o #\o)).
 | &gt; 
 | &gt; This appears to introduce type symbols like U16 and CHAR which are not
 | &gt; part of srfi-47.  The prototype functions in srfi-47 return arrays.
 | &gt; 
 | &gt;  | [...]
 | &gt; 
 | &gt; I am not opposed to also having SRFI-10 syntax for arrays.  This would
 | &gt; seem to require reserving a set of symbols for type specification,
 | &gt; which is an unschemely way of doing things.  Scheme goes to some
 | &gt; lengths to avoid using symbols as cookies; witness NULL? and
 | &gt; EOF-OBJECT?
 | 
 | Perhaps I'm confused, but I don't see much difference between my usage

 | nil and the EOF object -- and your usage of the suffixes of the new #A
 | syntax.  Could you elaborate on how my proposal is any worse in that
 | respect than yours?

To keep symbols-as-cookies out of Scheme to this point probably means
that some RRRS-author(s) is severly allergic to it.

I want arrays in R6RS.  I don't want to jeopardize array's chances by
making a proposal which looks like symbols-as-cookies, even if it is
not exactly true in a technical sense.

SRFI-10 mandates parentheses (eg. #,(infinity) instead of #,infinity).
This makes its SRFI-10 objects look like expressions to be evaluated.
SRFI-58 objects will be used as prototype array objects in calls to
MAKE-ARRAY:

(make-array '#1Ar64(1.0) 2 3)                   ; Current SRFI-58 syntax

(make-array '#,(Array 1 ar64 [1.0]) 2 3)        ; SRFI-10 style

(make-array '#,(Ar64 [1.0]) 2 3)                ; compact-SRFI-10 style.
                                                ; [] nesting gives rank.

(make-array    (Ar64 1.0) 2 3)                  ; Current SRFI-47 functions

    ==&gt; #2Ar64((1.0 1.0 1.0) (1.0 1.0 1.0))

The SRFI-10 style above looks like symbols-as-cookies.  The
compact-SRFI-10 style does not.  Do you like the compact-SRFI-10
style; or would it take too much of SRFI-10s namespace?

Having the read prefix use the same coding as the prototype functions
halves the (human) memory load.  If we move to nomenclature like
REAL-64, then I want prototype functions to be available with those
names:

(make-array '#,(Array 1 real-64 [0.0]) 2 3)     ; longer SRFI-10 Style

(make-array '#,(real-64 [0.0]) 2 3)             ; longer compact-SRFI-10

(make-array    (real-64 0.0) 2 3)               ; analogous SRFI-47 function

 | &gt;  | (I'd also prefer that the names be longer &amp; much more descriptive, like
 | &gt;  | UNSIGNED16 or BOOLEAN, but I suppose that's a little too late, now that
 | &gt;  | SRFI 47 has already been finalized &amp; the incomprehensible abbreviations
 | &gt;  | of array types have been set into stone...)
 | &gt; 
 | &gt; SRFI-47 defines procedures to return prototype arrays.  Additional
 | &gt; procedures can be added to alias the abbreviated ones.
 | 
 | This works for SRFI 47, but not necessarily this SRFI: one cannot
 | define one's own aliases for existing array types in the reader
 | syntax.

Yes.  That is why we are dicussing this now; before SRFI-58 is
finalized.

 | &gt; But explicitly complete descriptions for numeric types are rather
 | &gt; long:
 | &gt; 
 | &gt; [...long list...]
 | &gt; 
 | &gt; These long names present more of a burden for the memories of
 | &gt; non-English-speakers than the short names, which are the same for
 | &gt; everyone.
 | 
 | I'm not suggesting names so long that they induce tedium in typists,
 | but rather names somewhat longer than are excessively obscure, such as
 | INTEGER-U16, COMPLEX-64, BIT, et cetera.

This is requiring users to internalize assumptions that integers are
exact; and reals and complexes are not.  Scheme has a strong
propensity for calling things exactly what they are, witness
CALL-WITH-CURRENT-CONTINUATION, EOF-OBJECT?, LIST?, and PAIR?.

 | Furthermore, the single-character mnemonics are derived from

English doesn't much help remember Scheme exponent markers:

  The letters `s', `f', `d', and `l' specify the use of SHORT, SINGLE,
  DOUBLE, and LONG precision, respectively.

I don't usually think of a DOUBLE as shorter than a LONG.  And where
did `f' for SINGLE come from?  Maybe it is a C-ism.  In any case, it
is one of five characters (with 'e') rather than one of five longer
sequences to remember.

 | &gt; There is Scheme precedent for abbreviated names in identifiers
 | &gt; like CADR an CDADAR and in the radix and exactness prefixes #B,
 | &gt; #O, #D, #X, #E, #I.
 | 
 | ... A better analogue would be ARRAY-REF, but I haven't seen any
 | objections to that as opposed to AREF, and I much prefer ARRAY-REF
 | rather than AREF.

I am not opposed to longer names, but they must work together and they
must integrate well with Scheme.

 | Let me also point out here that much of Scheme's naming conventions

 | representation names used by Orbit's representation analyzer and

 | hold in Scheme as well.  I think it would be good to preserve that
 | in the array element type names as well.

I found my T2.7 manual, but it doesn't have FFIs in it.

If I come up with longer names and they aren't better than the current
system (used by SCM for many years), then I would be making a
straw-man.  Please replace the first column of this table with a set
of better names, so we can discuss this change in more concrete terms.
