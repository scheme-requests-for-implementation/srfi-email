&gt; One thing that has always bothered me about Scheme's I/O
&gt; system is the seemingly random presence of 'current
&gt; ports.'  I haven't been able to find a rationale for the
&gt; existence of the mechanism, and exactly what the 'current
&gt; {input,output} port' is meant to be used for has never
&gt; been clear to me.

I think that the input and output ports are the strongest
argument for dynamic variables in a Lisp.  Having adopted
Lexical scope, the scheme RnRS authors didn't want to muddy
the waters for just two variables, so they made them global
instead.

But this is a problem. If as an implementor you take them at
their word and implement a purely lexically-scoped language,
you'll find that the globals &quot;do the wrong thing&quot; in the
presence of call/cc, so you'll wind up making them dynamic
anyway and hiding the details under obfuscating
constructions like CALL-WITH-INPUT-PORT, etc.

&gt; Not only is the mechanism itself vague,
&gt; but it also introduces unnecessary complexities in the
&gt; interface: because the port argument to many operations is
&gt; optional (which I believe Mike doesn't like anyway), the
&gt; port must go last, which skews the possibility of other
&gt; optional arguments and which is contrary to the very
&gt; common convention of putting the important aggregate datum
&gt; in the first argument.

That &quot;very common convention&quot; you mentioned is a direct
consequence of single-argument type-based method dispatch,
which is the OO mechanism that first appeared in Smalltalk,
was popularized by C++ and now inherited by Java, C#, et al.
The convention did not exist yet when scheme adopted its
contrary convention.

Note that Lispy conventions of OO (as typified by CLOS)
mostly use multiple-argument method dispatch for their generic
functions, which eliminates the &quot;pride of place&quot; constraint
you mentioned, but which also creates problems with optional
arguments! *sigh*.

Perhaps what we want is keyword arguments?

&gt; I recognize that it can be useful to store different kinds
&gt; of 'current ports' in the dynamic environment, such as a
&gt; port for general noise output, a port for error output, or
&gt; ports for terminal interaction.  But I don't think that
&gt; the 'current input &amp; output ports,' as outlined by R5RS &amp;
&gt; the current SRFI document, suit any of these roles very
&gt; well, and I see no reason to make a special case for two
&gt; vaguely specified ports so that the argument conventions
&gt; of all of the port operations are skewed with respect to
&gt; optionality and inconsistent with their stream I/O
&gt; counterparts.

You're talking about the way function calls are written, but
the ugliness here (at least in Schemes that don't support
dynamic variables) goes way *way* deeper than that.

I think the reason current-input-port and
current-output-port have remained so vague and
underspecified is because as dynamic structures in a
lexically-scoped language, they are contrary to the design
of the rest of the language.  To specify them clearly and
precisely, you'd have to specify a lot of behavior that
scheme simply does not otherwise use.

&gt; Additionally, the procedures CURRENT-INPUT-PORT, CURRENT-OUTPUT-PORT,
&gt; CALL-WITH-CURRENT-INPUT-PORT, &amp; CALL-WITH-CURRENT-OUTPUT-PORT, would
&gt; all be removed.  The current error output port could still remain, and
&gt; I'd also recommend possibly adding a current noise output port, but it
&gt; is of little significance.


I have a very similar proposal that differs in a few
particulars and would break marginally less (but still most)
code while still cleaning up the design.

Let the current input and output ports be global _AND_IMMUTABLE_.
   (Then the threading and dynamic-variable problems go away)

Add a third global, immutable port, the current error port or
   current debug port.

Specify that they correspond to C's &quot;stdin/stdout/stderr&quot;, and
   while in a REPL, correspond to things read and written from
   the console, but allow for scheme &quot;scripts&quot; to be invoked
   with input redirected from or output redirected to pipes.

With these ports immutable, syntax that alters them in the
   scope of procedures called from those forms
   (CALL-WITH_FOO, etc) becomes nonsensical and must be
   removed.

With these procedures removed, the port must be passed explicitly
   in the lexical environment just like any other variable.
   Procedures that take &quot;optional&quot; port arguments should therefore
   be changed to take &quot;mandatory&quot; port arguments.

Library syntax for forms that write explicitly to the standard
   immutable ports would then become trivial to define.

&gt; I also have some suggestions for how to take advantage of
&gt; the new possibilities for making some arguments optional
&gt; introduced by the elimination of the current input &amp;
&gt; output ports, but that can be left for another mail.

Just to make sure you know, there's nothing stopping you from
having multiple optional arguments in the same call...  right?
