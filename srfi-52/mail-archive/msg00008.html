Alex raises this question:

     &gt; The question remains how to handle R5RS character predicates
     &gt; related to these values:

     &gt;   * char-alphabetic? char
     &gt;   * char-numeric? char
     &gt;   * char-whitespace? char   ; rename to char-white-space? please!
     &gt;   * char-upper-case? char   ; rename to char-uppercase? please!
     &gt;   * char-lower-case? char   ; rename to char-lowercase? please!

     &gt; As mentioned, it can be useful to have these functioning on
     &gt; pure ASCII for use in parsers and tools for common protocols.
     &gt; Moreover, the Unicode equivalents are often very expensive (if
     &gt; not in time then in space).  Should a Scheme that wants to
     &gt; provide the full Unicode equivalents of these extend the core
     &gt; procedures or should we define disjoint procedures such as

     &gt;   * char-unicode-alphabetic?


First, while I like the suggested renames (e.g., CHAR-LOWER-CASE -&gt;
CHAR-LOWERCASE), I think it is not the place of _this_ SRFI to propose
those changes.   They would do nothing to help implementations provide
Unicode support while also conforming to R6RS.

Second, I think it is essential that, regardless of any changes
proposed in this SRFI, those procedures must have the same behavior
they have in R5RS when applied to the &quot;portable Scheme character
set&quot;.   The portable character set is not quite ASCII (the integer
mappings are specified and not all ASCII characters are included, even
abstractly) -- but it can be regarded as a subset of the abstract
characters encoded in ASCII.

Third, should a Unicode Scheme extend those predicates?  or define new
ones?  In a weak sense, that's not a question for this SRFI.   I've
specified the answer I prefer in another draft (&quot;Scheme Characters as
(Extended) Unicode Codepoints&quot;,
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://regexps.srparish.net/srfi-drafts/unicode-chars.srfi">http://regexps.srparish.net/srfi-drafts/unicode-chars.srfi</a>) but those
answers should not be presumed by this SRFI.

What _are_ questions for this SRFI are: should an implementation be
_permitted_ to extend those predicates.  If so, should it be permitted
to extend them in the &quot;most natural&quot; way for Unicode characters?  (The
other draft I just mentioned explains what I think the &quot;most natural&quot;
way is.)

The strict letter of the law in R5RS says (by implication):

  ~ Yes, implementations _may_ extend those predicates.
    (They are, indeed, expected to do so.)

  ~ No, implementations _may_not_ use the most natural Unicode
    definitions.   In particular, R5RS requires that alphabetic
    characters must return an upper case equivalent from CHAR-UPCASE
    and a lower case equivalent from CHAR-DOWNCASE.   So the 
    specifications for all of these procedures:

	char-alphabetic?
        char-upper-case?		
        char-lower-case?
        char-upcase
        char-downcase
        char-ci=?

    are &quot;intertwingled&quot; in an unfortunate way: not all Unicode
    characters that ought to be considered &quot;alphabetic&quot; satisfy
    the case-mapping requirements of R5RS.

The situation is worsened by the relationship between those
procedures, STRING-CI=?, identifier equivalence, and the relationship
between a literal symbol name in a program text and the string
returned by SYMBOL-&gt;STRING for that symbol.  For example, R5RS says
(by implication) that the SYMBOL-&gt;STRING value can be formed from an
identifier name by applying one of (depending on the implementation's
preferred case) CHAR-UPCASE or CHAR-DOWNCASE to each character of the
identifier.  Unicode defines a (fairly complicated) algorithm defining
&quot;case-insensitive identifier equivalence&quot; -- but it has little resemblence
to the naive algorithm implied by R5RS.

My opinion is that R5RS is wrong to forbid the &quot;most natural&quot; Unicode
extensions of these standard procedures.  Some of the revisions
proposed in this SRFI are aimed at removing that restriction.

In designing the proposed revisions, I reasoned this way:

~ Incompatible Changes Must Not Be Made.

  Specifically, the unfortunate &quot;intertwingling&quot; of the procedures
  listed above all hinges on CHAR-ALPHABETIC?.   By happy coincidence,
  with a global character set, CHAR-ALPHABETIC? is a poor choice of
  name for the concept that procedure is intended to capture --
  CHAR-LETTER? (that's &quot;Letter&quot; in the broad sense of the Unicode
  standard) is a better name.

  Rather than undo the intertwingling by changing _any_ of the
  procedures in an incompatible way, it is simpler to leave 
  CHAR-ALPHABETIC? in its damaged state, deprecate it, and introduce a
  new procedure -- CHAR-LETTER? -- defined in a way that doesn't
  perpetuate the problems.


~ Implementations Must Provide the Identifier -&gt; Symbol Mapping

  The naive process of applying CHAR-UPCASE (or CHAR-DOWNCASE) to
  every character in an identifier to yield it's canonical symbol name
  is far removed from reality.

  The Unicode process for canonicalizing a symbol name is quite
  complicated and would require a great deal of more primitive
  machinery to implement in Scheme.

  Finally, this SRFI is _not_ intended to be Unicode-specific: only 
  to be Unicode-permissive.   So it is not the place of this SRFI to 
  specify a canonicalization algorithm.

  Therefore, I have proposed that the revised report just give general
  guidance (that case distincitions are ignored; that implementations
  have a preferred case) -- but that they must also provide their
  canonicalization algorithm as a required procedure.  Rather than
  trying to &quot;casemap identifiers&quot; themselves, programs should use the
  new STRING-&gt;SYMBOL-NAME procedure.


~ The Portable Characte Set Must Retain Its Simple Structure

  For example, if an identifier name is spelled using only the
  portable character set, then the CHAR-UPCASE (or DOWNCASE) technique
  for canonicalizing that identifier name should continue to work.

  Really, this requirement is a kind of &quot;corallary&quot; of the earlier
  one that &quot;Incompatible Changes Must Not Be Made&quot; but it is worth
  mentioning specially.

  In the draft SRFI, I have ensured that the portable character set
  retains its simple structure by including explicit language to that
  effect.   For example, CHAR-UPCASE and CHAR-DOWNCASE are described:

     These procedures return a character CHAR2 such that 
     (CHAR-CI=? CHAR CHAR2). In addition, CHAR-UPCASE must 
     map a..z to A..Z and CHAR-DOWNCASE must map A..Z to a..z.
