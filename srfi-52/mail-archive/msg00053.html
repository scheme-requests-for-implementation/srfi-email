<pre>Agreed.

But feel compelled to observe that once an object's internal representation
is formatted/encoded to/from whatever external representations form is
desired/required, it is then essentially in binary form; therefore binary
I/O actually represents the root common port format for of all I/O; where
more abstract ports may be thought of as merely munging on the data prior to
sending (or after receiving) it trough a binary port; which although it may
seem like a subtlety, if scheme were to view ports in this hierarchical way,
it could form the basis of a very flexible data transformation and I/O
architecture.

Thanks for your time and patience, -paul-

&gt; Subject: Re: Encodings.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It has long been my opinion that scheme needs binary I/O capabilities
&gt; to be standardized.  Character ports should be distinguished from
&gt; binary ports at a low level, and binary I/O operations should be
&gt; different operations from character I/O operations.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm entirely happy with (read-char) and (write-char) reading &quot;a
&gt; character&quot; (although I'll note that opinions vary on what a character
&gt; is, nuff said) or having (read) or (write) read or write a data object
&gt; in the external representation form which is made of characters.
&gt; 
&gt; Those are character operations, and when dealing strictly with
&gt; character operations, the appropriate place for concerns about
&gt; encoding, endianness, and external canonicalization are below the
&gt; level of the program's notice.  Fold all that stuff into the port code
&gt; for character ports and don't bother the programmer with it.  As far
&gt; as text processing code is concerned, a character is a character is a
&gt; character, or at least that's how it should be.
&gt; 
&gt; That leaves implementors the freedom to implement their character
&gt; ports in terms of whatever abstraction their particular platform uses
&gt; for characters, whether its utf8be or utf32le or ascii or ebcdic or
&gt; latin1 or ISO-foo or iscii or PETscii or the ZX81 charset or some
&gt; other embedded processor weirdness.  This is not a bug, it's a
&gt; feature.  If there are multiple encodings/canonicalizations/etc in use
&gt; on a system, let schemes on those systems implement multiple kinds of
&gt; character ports.
&gt; 
&gt; But it follows that there is NO WAY we should rely on I/O of
&gt; characters through character ports to read or write a particular
&gt; binary representation for &quot;raw&quot; data such as sound and image files.
&gt; Attempting to do so is bad design, because it breaks an abstraction
&gt; barrier and presumes things which are beyond the program's proper
&gt; control or knowledge.
&gt; 
&gt; The only reason programmers want to write characters that aren't in
&gt; the &quot;normal&quot; encoding/canonicalization/etc, is when they need really
&gt; close control of the exact format of I/O.  But when you need control
&gt; *that* close, you're not talking about a &quot;character&quot; port at all any
&gt; more; you're talking about binary I/O.  Rather than breaking the
&gt; abstraction barrier on character ports, you need a different kind of
&gt; port.  We need binary ports that support operations like (read-bytes)
&gt; and (write-bytes).
&gt; 
&gt; It may be needful to read and write &quot;characters&quot; on these ports; but
&gt; character fields inside binary data formats tend to be both very rigid
&gt; and diverse in their encoding/etc, so character operations on binary
&gt; ports, if supported at all, should IMO have mandatory arguments to
&gt; specify their encoding/etc.
