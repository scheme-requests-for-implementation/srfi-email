&gt; &gt; Another case where this kind of thing arises is in the
&gt; &gt; implementation of priority inheritance mutexes. In this case each
&gt; &gt; mutex has an associated priority

&gt; I'm not sure I followed you. First of all, if the mutex isn't assigned
&gt; the highest priority of any task that acquires it, the potential for
&gt; priority inversion (a low priority task executes while a higher
&gt; priority task is blocked) is still there. 

Guilty. I forgot this requirement and opnly remembered it when I was
working out precisely *why* I had a hard time implementing them later.

&gt; Second of all, a correct
&gt; implementation of priority inheritence raises the temporary priority
&gt; of the task holding the mutex each time a higher priority task
&gt; attempts to acquire the mutex. As soon as it releases the mutex, the
&gt; task's priority returns to the priority it had before it acquired the
&gt; mutex. Since a task can hold several mutexes, this requires a stack of
&gt; (increasing) priorities, with the priority at the bottom of the stack
&gt; being the task's original priority. 

This doesn't seem quite right, but I expect that you know better than
I. It seems like you need a priority stack per task/mutex? But that's
not particularly germane to SRFI-18.

&gt; I see nothing in the integer
&gt; implementation that would prevent the use of integer priorities. In
&gt; fact, priority inheritence is routinely done in fixed priority RT
&gt; systems.

Integer priority was *not* the difficulty. The difficulty was avoiding
a race condition on mutex release while trying to restore the original
thread priority. The result of the race was a incorrect restored
priority. If I'm totally confused, please excuse me, this *was* over a
year ago.

The point of my examples was to show the usefulness of
WITHOUT-SCHEDULING in implementing complex priority management
schemes.

&gt; I believe Marc's objection to parameterizing the scheduler with
&gt; THREAD-PRIORITY&gt;? (or allowing modular schedulers) 

Aren't these two very different problems? THREAD-PRIORITY&gt;? would be a
small subset of a modular scheduler. The idea is that the &gt; comparison
is in there anyway, why not expose it? Then we get a number of
benefits to the specification (e.g. no need to say anything more about
priority).

&gt; is that it is very
&gt; difficult to design the rest of the thread/mutex/condition variable
&gt; system abstractly enough to allow things to work without heavy
&gt; penalties in performance. (Depending on your definitions of
&gt; &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;performance&quot;, the design may be impossible.)

I have no way to judge. I'm just (at the moment) a whingeing
user. Whichever way Marc goes with this, we'll be ahead of where we
are now.

&gt; Furthermore, the properties of the system depend critically upon the
&gt; parameterizing comparison function hence it makes the use of
&gt; independently developed libraries which use threads problematic. Their
&gt; semantics will change depending on the comparision function you
&gt; install.

Which I think is the point of having the scheduler parametric on the
priority comparison function. The SRFI can guarantee properties based
on the standard THREAD-PRIORITY&gt;? but you're on yer own if you
implement yer own. Additionally, follow-on SRFIs could just
standardize THREAD-PRIORITY&gt;? to get a new standardized thread system
behavior.
