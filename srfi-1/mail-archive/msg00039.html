<pre>* Naming: iota

John Stone &lt;jstone@xxxxxxxxxxx&gt; writes:
&gt;
&gt;        I understand the rationale for bounds-based numeric sequences
&gt;better now, but after some introspection I've realized that since I
&gt;always think of APL's iota operator as count-based, I'm having trouble
&gt;seeing :IOTA and IOTA: as direct extensions of it.
&gt;
&gt;        So I'd suggest keeping the Evans-style IOTA and thinking up
&gt;different names for :IOTA and IOTA:.  Though R5RS-conformant, these aren't
&gt;ideal names anyway, since they use a character that's likely to be treated
&gt;as special either by module systems or by systems that introduce
&gt;Common-Lisp-style keywords.  For :IOTA, I'd use the name SEQUENCE.  I don't
&gt;feel as much need for a short name for the much less frequently wanted
&gt;IOTA: procedure -- SKIP-SEQUENCE, perhaps, or maybe EQUENCE, would carry
the
&gt;right connotation of stumbling slightly at the beginning, on discovering
&gt;the absence of the expected initial value.


I agree that :IOTA and IOTA: names are far from ideal; SEQUENCE is
also not a good choice because of its historical associations with BEGIN
and common usage in CL community.
There is a 4th option not mentioned in the Olin's list: remove all IOTAs
from
the SRFI. I think they just don't worth the controversy...

* TAKE &amp; DROP


John Stone &lt;jstone@xxxxxxxxxxx&gt; writes:
&gt;        As I see it, the functionality question is whether there is any
&gt;analogy between the structure of the integers -- negative, zero, and
&gt;positive -- and the structure of the operations that, say, DROP performs on
&gt;its argument when given a negative, zero, or positive value.  If there is
&gt;no such analogy, having DROP accept negative arguments is just a kludge,
&gt;and we should get rid of it regardless of the consequences to the
&gt;namespace.


Couldn't agree more.

&gt;        But I think that there is such an analogy.  Here's the vision I
&gt;have: DROP sets up a cutting board, with the list spread out from left to
&gt;right in the middle of the board, and a pair of blades, hovering above the
&gt;board, separated horizontally by the number of elements in the list.  The
&gt;numerical argument now positions the blades: If it is zero, the blades are
&gt;positioned at the beginning and end of the list; if it is negative, both
&gt;blades are shifted leftwards; if it is positive, they are shifted
&gt;rightwards.  Finally the blades fall, and the return value is the segment
&gt;of the list that lies between them; the rest is lopped off.  TAKE is
&gt;similar, except that we return the lopped-off part.


This is an interesting analogy indeed. The problem as I see it is that
this analogy is way too complex for a supposedly primitive procedures
like TAKE and DROP. It is possible to give an analogy for a lot of things
given a cutting board and two blades -- imagine what can be done if
you add a fork! :)

As for the namespace pollution, I think we can consider these options too:
a) sacrifice variants that operate on lists 'from end' -- lists are
sequential
structures and operations that work 'upstream' are significantly slower
and are probably less useful in practice.
b) leave out STRING-TAKE, VECTOR-DROP etc. Strings and vectors
have constant-time access and SUBLIST/SUBVECTOR are adequate
in most cases

* Add SUBLIST?

I agree with Olin's analysis in general,  but I think that SUBLIST *is*
an acceptable replacement for variants of TAKE / DROP working
'from end' (and it has the same performance characteristics).

To be compatible with SUBSTRING, I would leave out all fancy indexing
features from SUBLIST's specification; making the END argument
optional is also an overkill - one may just use DROP or LIST-TAIL.

SUBLIST! can also be useful.
