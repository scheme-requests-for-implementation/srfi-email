<pre>* Naming: right &amp; left variants

I prefer FOLD and FOLD-RIGHT (and DROP / DROP-RIGHT).
FOLD-LEFT and FOLD-RIGHT are also good choices.


*IMPROPER LISTS

Olin Shivers writes:
&gt;I try for an &quot;accept a wide spectrum&quot; approach to the inputs the list
&gt;functions take, and intend to spec as many of these procedures to work on
&gt;improper lists as possible. Procedures that work on improper lists must be
&gt;able to treat any non-pair as a list-tail signifying the end of the list --
&gt;that is, the empty list. E.g. a robust LENGTH function that handles
improper
&gt;lists must be spec'd so that both of these calls return three:
&gt;    (length '(a b c . ())) =&gt; 3 ; Proper
&gt;    (length '(a b c . d))  =&gt; 3 ; Improper


I think that the whole idea of &quot;robustness&quot; (meaning don't break under
any circumstances) is not in a Scheme tradition: after all these years
spent trying to convince programmers that (car '()) is an error,
we are back to (length &quot;abc&quot;) =&gt; 0. Since &quot;improper list&quot; is synonymous
to &quot;any object&quot; (anything or a pair = anything), we will end up with a
list library that accepts (and often produces) nonsensical data.

correct code:
(filter even? '(2 7 1 8 2))  =&gt; (2 8 2)

incorrect code, but no error is likely to be signalled, because
the list is never 'applied' (but improperness is propagated)
(filter '(2 7 1 8 2) even?) =&gt; #{procedure even?}

This &quot;result&quot; can be propagated further without any warning:
(length (filter '(2 7 1 8 2) even?)) =&gt; 0 ;no even numbers?

Olin Shivers writes:
&gt;This is the simplest, most consistent spec that covers improper lists.

&gt;The functions in the current reference implementation have this property.

&gt;
&gt;In this spirit, *all* of the procedures in list-lib are defined to work
&gt;on improper lists.


The last phrase translates as follows: &quot;*all* of the procedures in list-lib
are defined to accept *any* objects, not only lists&quot;. And still, the
&quot;consistency&quot;
will require to redefine NULL? and LIST? to return #t on all atoms
(actually,
LIST? should return #t on everything)...

Couple more nonsensical (but legal under this SRFI) expressions:

(length (current-input-port)) =&gt; 0
(append 1 2 3 4) =&gt; 4 ;improperness is propagated
(append &quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot;) =&gt; &quot;bar&quot;

Olin Shivers writes:
&gt;There is a trade-off here. On one hand, widening the set of arguments
&gt;acceptable to our utilities reduces our ability to provide error-checks
&gt;when an improper list means an error. On the other, it widens the
&gt;applicability of these procedures. I tilt towards the latter. Scheme
&gt;supports improper lists; so I will support them. Were this ML, the issue
&gt;would not arise -- tuple-trees and lists are statically distinguished by
&gt;the type system.


My own experience (~8 years of Scheme programming) tells that
improper lists are VERY rear (probably because Scheme discouraged
their use for a long time); the only exceptions are pieces of compilers/
interpreters dealing with lambda lists. So widening the applicability
to cover improper lists (i.e. everything else) in this manner doesn't
give too much; on the other hand, it seriously affects understanding
and reasoning about Scheme code. There are other, less dramatic
ways to widen the applicability of these functions: allow them to
handle vectors, strings and other sequences. This is done nicely
in OakLisp; I don't insist that this is a good idea in general, but it
doesn't affect understanding and doesn't complicate type inference.

It is certainly true that Scheme supports improper lists; R2RS
even had a special term &quot;proper list&quot; and both kinds were treated
as equally important. But starting from R3RS, Scheme is moving
away from improper lists in both terminology and functionality.
Anybody can build improper and circular &quot;lists&quot;, but I think
that corresponding functions should be named accordingly
and moved out of the *list* library. Things like IMPROPER-LIST-LENGTH
are much easier to spot in somebody else's code: you can see that
something unusual is going on there.

&gt;
&gt;Or, let's put it another way: CONS, CAR and CDR support improper lists,
&gt;so we need to follow through.


This is a terminological error: CAR and CDR work on pairs, which are
neither subset or superset of lists. Nonempty lists is proper subset
of pairs; this allows us to use CAR and CDR on nonempty lists. CONS
accepts any objects and returns a pair; it has a property that if its
second argument is restricted to lists, its result will be a nonempty list.
As I mentioned before, &quot;improper list&quot; means &quot;any object&quot;. CONS,
CAR and CDR do not support &quot;any objects&quot;; they obey rules that
are not as easy as I would like them to be, but these rules can be
used by soft-typing compiler and enforced at run time.

Sergei
