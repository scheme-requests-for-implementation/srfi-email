<pre>1. I am staying with ! for the linear-update suffix.

2. Sergei is right: UNFOLD comes in directional flavors, in concert
   with the two directions of FOLD. I am sticking with the FOO and FOO-RIGHT
   general convention, and adding the left unfold. I am also making the
   tail parameter an optional argument, hence unfold/tail is going away.
   This gives us
	unfold       p f g seed [tail]
	unfold-right p f g seed [tail-gen]

   I append the new specs.

3. I have added two more procedures. The first is taken from Common Lisp:
       count PRED list1 list2 ... -&gt; integer
   It applies PRED across the lists and returns the number of the
   true values thus produced. My experience, at least, tells me this
   is a very common operation; one worth naming.

   Secondly, I realised that list-lib has no equality procedure for lists!
   It's a check-list item: constructor, selector, predicate, comparison.
   So I have added one:
      list= elt= lis1 ...
   Two proper lists are equal if they are the same and their elements are
   equal (as determined by ELT=). It is an error to apply LIST= to anything
   except proper lists. Implementations may choose to extend it to circular
   lists. It cannot reasonably be extended to dotted lists, as there is
   no way to specify an equality procedure for comparing the list terminators.

   I did not add list *inequality* procedures LIST&lt; and LIST&lt;=. What would
   they be? Elementwise &quot;tuple&quot; comparison is one possibility, but so is
   lexicographic order. If lexicographic order, then which endianness is
   used? Taking left elements to be more significant than right elements
   fits the natural implementation of the comparison function, but one 
   could argue that, given that we *construct* lists right-to-left, the
   most significant elements should be the earliest ones, i.e., the rightmost
   ones. In practice, these issues will be application-specific. In the
   absence of a clear-cut obvious single choice, I decided it was best not
   to institutionalise a particular comparison semantics in the library.

   I mention these inequality issues mostly to have them in the discussion
   record for future reference.

   I append the new specs for COUNT and LIST=.

5. I also considered adding, along the lines of LIST=, a TREE= function:
	   (define (tree= elt= x y)
             (let recur ((x x) (y y))
               (if (pair? x)
                   (and (pair? y)
                        (recur (car x) (car y))
                        (recur (cdr x) (cdr y)))
                   (and (not (pair? y))
		        (elt= x y)))))
   Then I realised that besides TREE= and TREE-COPY, we also want
   various kinds of tree folding operations, tree unfolders, tree
   mappers, ...

   Partial coverage is bogus. So I'm killing TREE-COPY, and have no
   tree procs at all. Designing a good tree library is a thoughtful
   task; it's time to push this library out into the world, so we
   will leave that for another time, another library, another SRFI
   process.

5. I have more carefully specified the list-set operations, which were 
   not spec'd in a detailed way. I append the definitions.

   The two most significant design elements of my spec for the 
   list-set operations are:

   - The element-equality predicate must be &quot;consistent&quot; with EQ?. That
     is, for element-comparison function elt=,
	(eq? x y) =&gt; (elt= x y).
     This, in turn, implies that two lists that are EQ? are set-equal under
     any legal element-comparison function.

   - I have pretty carefully pinned down what the set ops do. For
     example, the intersection operator returns a filtered version
     of its first list argument -- elements are not disordered from
     the order in which they appear in the first list argument. One
     reason for such a spec is so that programmers can use ordered
     lists as sets, without disarranging useful order that might be
     important in later, non-set use of the results.

     Other points that are unambiguously pinned down are how
     multiple occurences of identical elements in a list are
     handled, and what order arguments are given to the element 
     comparison procedure.

     So there's more in the spec than is strictly necessary for the
     bare requirements of a set operation, but it does make for a
     complete and reliable specification of the list-&gt;list operation
     performed.

   - The spec is tuned to allow fast, constant-time execution in
     specific special cases (EQ? arguments, () arguments).

6. I've gone ahead and added the R5RS text for all the R5RS procs exported
   by this library (CONS, CAR, CDR, ASSQ, ...), so the document is a complete
   spec/reference.

7. I have put a lot of work into updating the documentation. The HTML, in
   particular, is now nicely formatted; I have built a CSS style sheet for
   writing up SRFI's and other HTML documents that define procedures; it
   even exploits bugs in Netscape's CSS handling to work around other bugs
   in Netscape's CSS handling, and works fine with IE. But the HTML text
   is now also out-of-date wrt the text version. For the current state of
   the SRFI, be sure and check the text version:
       <a  rel="nofollow" href="ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/people/shivers/srfi/srfi-1/srfi-1.txt">ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/people/shivers/srfi/srfi-1/srfi-1.txt</a>

The only one of these items on which I see much potential for
controversy is the spec for the list-set ops.

Whew.
    -Olin

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
list= elt= list1 ... -&gt; boolean
    Determines list equality, given an element-equality procedure.
    Proper list A equals proper list B if they are of the same length,
    and their elements are equal, as determined by ELT=. If the
    element-comparison procedure's first argument is from LISTi, then
    its second argument is from LISTi+1, i.e. it is always called as
        (elt= a b)
    for a an element of list A, and b an element of list B.

    In the n-ary case, every LISTi is compared to LISTi+1 (as opposed,
    for example, to comparing LIST1 to every LISTi, for i&gt;1). If there
    are no lists arguments at all, LIST= simply returns #t.

    It is an error to apply LIST= to anything except proper lists. While
    implementations may choose to extend it to circular lists, note that it
    cannot reasonably be extended to dotted lists, as it provides no way to
    specify an equality procedure for comparing the list terminators.

    Note that the dynamic order in which the ELT= procedure is applied to
    pairs of elements is not specified. For example, if LIST= is applied
    to three lists, A, B, and C, it may first completely compare A to B,
    then compare B to C, or it may compare the first elements of A and B,
    then the first elements of B and C, then the second elements of A and
    B, and so forth.

    The equality procedure must be consistent with EQ?. That is, 
    it must be the case that
	(eq? x y) =&gt; (elt= x y).
    Note that this implies that two lists which are EQ? are always LIST=,
    as well.

count pred clist1 clist2 ... -&gt; integer
    PRED is a procedure taking as many arguments as there
    are lists and returning a single value. It is applied 
    element-wise to the elements of the LISTs, and a count is
    tallied of the number of true values produced. This count
    is returned. COUNT is &quot;iterative&quot; in that it is guaranteed
    to apply PRED to the LIST elements in a left-to-right order.
    The counting stops when the shortest list expires.

        (count even? '(3 1 4 1 5 9 2 5 6)) =&gt; 3
        (count &lt; '(1 2 4 8) '(2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16)) =&gt; 3

    At least one of the argument lists must be finite:
	(count &lt; '(3 1 4 1) (circular-list 1 10)) =&gt; 2

unfold p f g seed [tail] -&gt; value
    UNFOLD constructs a list with the following loop:
        (let lp ((seed seed) (lis tail))
          (if (p seed) lis
              (lp (g seed)
                  (cons (f seed) lis))))

    P: Determines when to stop unfolding.
    F: Maps each seed value to the corresponding list element.
    G: Maps each seed value to next seed value.
    SEED: The &quot;state&quot; value for the unfold.
    TAIL: list terminator; defaults to '().

    UNFOLD is the fundamental iterative list constructor, just as FOLD is the
    fundamental iterative list consumer. While UNFOLD may seem a bit abstract
    to novice functional programmers, it can be used in a number of ways:

	(unfold zero?			; List of squares: 1^2 ... 10^2.
		(lambda (x) (* x x))
		(lambda (x) (- x 1))
		10)
		
	(unfold null-list? car cdr lis) ; Reverse a proper list.

	;; Read current input port into a list of values.
	(unfold eof-object? values (lambda (x) (read)) (read))

	;; (APPEND-REVERSE rev-head tail)
	(unfold null-list? car cdr rev-head tail)

    Interested functional programmers may enjoy noting that FOLD and UNFOLD
    are in some sense inverses. That is, given operations KNULL?, KAR, KDR, 
    KONS, and KNIL satisfying
	(kons (kar x) (kdr x)) = x  and (knull? knil) = #t
    then
	(FOLD kons knil (UNFOLD knull? kar kdr x)) = x
    and
	(UNFOLD knull? kar kdr (FOLD kons knil x)) = x.

    This combinator presumably has some pretentious mathematical name;
    interested readers are invited to communicate it to the author.

unfold-right p f g seed [tail-gen]-&gt; list
    UNFOLD-RIGHT is best described by its basic recursion:
	(unfold-right p f g seed) = (if (p seed) (tail-gen seed)
                                        (cons (f seed)
                                              (unfold-right p f g (g seed))))
    P: Determines when to stop unfolding.
    F: Maps each seed value to the corresponding list element.
    G: Maps each seed value to next seed value.
    SEED: The &quot;state&quot; value for the unfold.
    TAIL-GEN: creates the tail of the list; defaults to (lambda (x) '())

    UNFOLD-RIGHT is the fundamental recursive list constructor, just as
    FOLD-RIGHT is the fundamental recursive list consumer. While UNFOLD-RIGHT
    may seem a bit abstract to novice functional programmers, it can be used
    in a number of ways:

	(unfold-right (lambda (x) (&gt; x 10))	; List of squares: 1^2 ... 10^2.
		      (lambda (x) (* x x))
		      (lambda (x) (+ x 1))
		      1)
		
	(unfold-right null-list? car cdr lis)	; Copy a proper list.

	;; Read current input port into a list of values.
	(unfold-right eof-object? values (lambda (x) (read)) (read))

	;; Copy a possibly non-proper list:
	(unfold-right not-pair? car cdr lis 
                      values)

	;; Append HEAD onto TAIL:
	(unfold-right null-list? car cdr head 
                      (lambda (x) tail))

    Interested functional programmers may enjoy noting that FOLD-RIGHT and
    UNFOLD-RIGHT are in some sense inverses. That is, given operations KNULL?,
    KAR, KDR, KONS, and KNIL satisfying
	(kons (kar x) (kdr x)) = x  and (knull? knil) = #t
    then
	(FOLD-RIGHT kons knil (UNFOLD-RIGHT knull? kar kdr x)) = x
    and
	(UNFOLD-RIGHT knull? kar kdr (FOLD-RIGHT kons knil x)) = x.

    This combinator sometimes is called an &quot;anamorphism;&quot; when an
    explicit TAIL-GEN procedure is supplied, it is called an
    &quot;apomorphism.&quot;


** Set operations on lists
==========================
The following procedures all take an = argument used to compare
elements of lists. This equality procedure is required to be
consistent with EQ?. That is, it must be the case that
	   (eq? x y) =&gt; (= x y).
Note that this implies, in turn, that two lists that are EQ? are
also set-equal by any legal comparison procedure. This allows for
constant-time determination of set operations on EQ? lists.

Be aware that these procedures typically run in time O(n * m) for N-
and M-element list arguments.  Performance-critical applications
operating upon large sets will probably wish to use other data
structures and algorithms.

lset&lt;= = list1 ... -&gt; boolean
    Returns true iff every LISTi is a subset of LISTi+1, using = for the
    element equality procedure. List A is a subset of list B if every
    element in A is equal to some element of B. When performing an
    element comparison, the = procedure's first argument is an element
    of A; its second, an element of B.

    (lset&lt;= eq? '(a) '(a b a) '(a b c c)) =&gt; #t

    (lset&lt;= eq?) =&gt; #t		; Trivial cases
    (lset&lt;= eq? '(a)) =&gt; #t


lset= = list1 list2 ... -&gt; boolean
    Returns true iff every LISTi is set-equal to LISTi+1, using = for
    the element equality procedure. &quot;Set-equal&quot; simply means that
    LISTi is a subset of LISTi+1, and LISTi+1 is a subset of LISTi.

    (lset= eq? '(b e a) '(a e b) '(e e b a)) =&gt; #t

    (lset= eq?) =&gt; #t		; Trivial cases
    (lset= eq? '(a)) =&gt; #t

lset-adjoin = list elt1 ... -&gt; list
    Adds the ELTi elements not already in the list parameter to the 
    result list. The result shares a common tail with the list parameter.
    The new elements are added to the front of the list, but no guarantees
    are made about their order. The = parameter is an equality procedure
    used to determine if an ELTi is already a member of LIST. Its first 
    argument is an element of LIST; its second is one of the ELTi.

    The list parameter is always a suffix of the result -- even if the list
    parameter contains repeated elements, these are not reduced.

    (lset-adjoin eq? '(a b c d c e) 'a 'e 'i 'o 'u) =&gt; (u o i a b c d c e)

lset-union = list1 ... -&gt; list
    Returns the union of the lists, using = for the element equality
    procedure. 

    The union of lists A and B is constructed as follows:
        - If A is the empty list, the answer is B (or a copy of B).
        - Otherwise, the result is initialised to be list A (or a copy of A).
	- Proceed through the elements of list B in a left-to-right order.
	  If b is such an element of B, compare every element r of the current
	  result list to b: (= r b). If all comparisons fail, b is consed
	  onto the front of the result.
    However, there is no guarantee that = will be applied to every pair
    of arguments from A and B. In particular, if A is EQ? to B, the operation
    may immediately terminate.

    In the n-ary case, the two-argument list-union operation is simply
    folded across the argument lists.

    (lset-union eq? '(a b c d e) '(a e i o u)) =&gt; (u o i a b c d e)
    
    ;; Repeated elements in LIST1 are preserved.
    (lset-union eq? '(a a c) '(x a x)) =&gt; (x a a c)

    (lset-union eq?)          =&gt; ()		; Trivial cases
    (lset-union eq? '(a b c)) =&gt; (a b c)

lset-intersection = list1 list2 ... -&gt; list
    Returns the intersection of the lists, using = for the element equality
    procedure. 

    The intersection of lists A and B is comprised of every element of A
    that is = to some element of B: (= a b), for a in A, and b in B.
    Note this implies that an element which appears in B and multiple times
    in list A will also appear multiple times in the result.

    The order in which elements appear in the result is the same as
    they appear in LIST1 -- that is, LSET-INTERSECTION essentially
    filters LIST1, without disarranging element order. The result may
    share a common tail with LIST1.

    In the n-ary case, the two-argument list-intersection operation is simply
    folded across the argument lists. However, the dynamic order in which the
    applications of = are made is not specified. The procedure may check an
    element of LIST1 for membership in every other list before proceeding to
    consider the next element of LIST1, or it may completely intersect LIST1
    and LIST2 before proceeding to LIST3, or it may go about its work in some
    third order.

    (lset-intersection eq? '(a b c d e) '(a e i o u)) =&gt; (a e)
    
    ;; Repeated elements in LIST1 are preserved.
    (lset-intersection eq? '(a x y a) '(x a x z)) =&gt; '(a x a)

    (lset-intersection eq? '(a b c)) =&gt; (a b c)	; Trivial case
    
lset-difference = list1 list2 ... -&gt; list
    Returns the difference of the lists, using = for the element equality
    procedure -- all the elements of LIST1 that are not = to any element from
    one of the other LISTi parameters. 

    The = procedure's first argument is always an element of LIST1; its second
    is an element of one of the other LISTi. The result may share a common
    tail with LIST1. Elements that are repeated multiple times in the LIST1
    parameter will occur multiple times in the result. No constraint is placed
    on the ordering of the elements in the result. The result may share a
    common tail with LIST1.

    (lset-difference eq? '(a b c d e) '(a e i o u)) =&gt; (b c d)

    (lset-difference eq? '(a b c)) =&gt; (a b c) ; Trivial case

lset-xor = list1 ... -&gt; list
    Returns the XOR of the lists, using = for the element equality
    procedure. If there are exactly two lists, this is all the elements
    that appear in exactly one of the two lists. The operation is associative,
    and thus extends to the n-ary case -- the elements that appear in an
    odd number of the lists. The result may share a common tail with any of
    the LISTi parameters.

    More precisely, for two lists A and B, A xor B is a list of
        - every element a of A such that there is no element b of B
          such that (= a b)
        - every element b of B such that there is no element a of A
          such that (= b a)
    In the n-ary case, the binary-xor operation is simply folded across
    the lists.

    (lset-xor eq? '(a b c d e) '(a e i o u)) =&gt; (d c b i o u)
    
    ;; Trivial cases.
    (lset-xor eq?) =&gt; ()
    (lset-xor eq? '(a b c d e)) =&gt; (a b c d e)

lset-diff+intersection = list1 list2 ... -&gt; [list list]
    Returns two values -- the difference and the intersection of the lists.
    Is equivalent to 
        (values (lset-difference   = list1 list2 ...)
	        (lset-intersection = list1 list2 ...))
    but can be implemented more efficiently.

    The = procedure's first argument is an element of LIST1; its second is
    an element of one of the other LISTi.

    Either of the answer lists may share a common tail with LIST1.
    This operation essentially partitions LIST1.

lset-union!        	= list1 ... -&gt; list
lset-intersection! 	= list1 list2 ... -&gt; list
lset-difference!   	= list1 list2 ... -&gt; list
lset-xor!          	= list1 ... -&gt; list
lset-diff+intersection! = list1 list2 ... -&gt; [list list]
    These are linear-update variants. They are allowed, but not required,
    to use the cons cells in their first list parameter to construct their
    answer. LSET-UNION! is permitted to recycle cons cells from *any* of its
    list arguments.
