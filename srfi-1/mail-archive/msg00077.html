<pre>You guys just love messing with my life, don't you? Enough of this
last-minute, stay-of-execution, midnight-phone-call-from-the-governor
stuff. Throw the switch and let's fry this thing.

   From: Dan Bornstein &lt;danfuzz@xxxxxxxx&gt;
   Date: Thu, 12 Aug 1999 13:02:39 -0700 (PDT)

   I've been thinking a lot about the whole linear update issue, and I agree
   that having a way to advise the system about object use without forcing a
   particular paradigm (destructive or not) is a good thing. However, the
   simple fact is that the pre-existing meaning of &quot;!&quot; in Scheme is *not*
   linear update--it is destructive modification--as most obviously
   demonstrated by these procedures:

       set!
       set-car!
       set-cdr!

   What would each of these mean if they were linear update anyway? They all
   return unspecified values, for one thing, so if they were recast in a
   linear update light, that would have to change. But let's say that you did
   that, then there are still problems. For example, set-cdr! is often used to
   create circular lists, but if it were defined to be nondestructive in a
   particular implementation, there would be no way to do this.

No, no. SET-CAR! and SET-CDR! are undoubtedly non-linear, guaranteed
side-effecting procedures. I do not mean to imply otherwise.

Here's my take on the linear list procedures. REVERSE!, APPEND! and friends
have been around for a while, even though they aren't RnRS. These procedures
have *always* had to be used in a &quot;linear&quot; fashion, even before I came along
and did list-lib -- because of the empty list.

That is, you cannot, *in general,* rely on this working:
     (begin (append! foo bar)
            foo) ; Use FOO non-linearly -- is now a longer list
The problem is that FOO might be bound to (). Then APPEND has nothing to
SET-CDR!; it just returns BAR. 

All the side-effecting list procedures have this property. If you provide a
guaranteed side-effecting list procedure, in general you must use it in in a
linear fashion (note I said &quot;in general&quot; -- if you can guarantee that the list
argument is non-empty, then you can get around this). In other words, you
*can't* provide a guaranteed side-effecting list procedure, really, because
*not all lists can be side-effected.*

I would have used another convention if I'd been able to think one up.
But neither I nor anyone else had a really good idea. I suppose I could
have used a &quot;1&quot; suffix (e.g., APPEND1, REVERSE1) for &quot;linear,&quot; but that
is obscure and seems ugly to me.

Very well. Let us take one more vote. Would people like to see the linear
update procs renamed to
   take1
   drop-right1
   append1
   append-reverse1
   append-map1 
   map1
   filter1
   partition1
   remove1 
   delete1 
   delete-duplicates1
   alist-delete1
   reverse1
   lset-union1
   lset-intersection1
   lset-difference1 
   lset-xor1
   lset-diff+intersection1

I am *not* going to provide procedures that are guaranteed-side-effecting-
when-possible-otherwise-functional. Ech. I *will* consider renaming these
procedures. But this 1-suffix convention is pretty ugly, and you are going to
see it again and again in the SRFI's I am getting ready to propose for
vectors, character sets, strings, sorting, etc.
