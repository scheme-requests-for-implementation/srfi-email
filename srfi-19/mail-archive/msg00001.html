<pre>Some quick responses to quick comments.

&gt; -----Original Message-----
&gt; From: Marc Feeley [<a  rel="nofollow" href="mailto:feeley@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx">mailto:feeley@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</a>]
&gt; Sent: Monday, March 13, 2000 12:24 PM
&gt; To: srfi-19@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
&gt; Subject: leap seconds
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; After a very quick look at SRFI-19 I have the following comments:
&gt;
&gt; 1) The interface assumes that there are exactly 86400 seconds in a
&gt; day.  This is not true.  There can be exactly 86399, 86400 and 86401
&gt; seconds in a day, due to &quot;leap seconds&quot;.  Note that the point in time
&gt; where the leap seconds are added (or removed) is under the control of
&gt; a committee and there is no deterministic algorithm to determine in
&gt; advance where they occur (it all depends on the speed of rotation of
&gt; the earth which varies slightly, up and down, due to various factor).
&gt; So the &quot;seconds&quot; component should be in the range 0-60 inclusive.
&gt; According to &quot;man ctime&quot; under linux, the seconds field can go up to
&gt; 61, but I don't understand why that high.  You should probably
&gt; research this a little more.  Here are some interesting sources of
&gt; information:
&gt;
&gt;    <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.990505.html">http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.990505.html</a>
&gt;    <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.naggum.no/lugm-time.html">http://www.naggum.no/lugm-time.html</a>
&gt;

It doesn't assume this many seconds in a year; it defines this many
seconds in a year. One advantage is that you get a deterministic
algorithm (as you say). Another important advantage is that you can
treat time as a number, and use standard mathematical operators. The
disadvantage is that drift from UTC, as you say.

&gt; 2) To be consistent with Scheme naming convention and practice, you
&gt; should rename &quot;get-universal-time&quot; to &quot;current-time&quot;,
&gt; &quot;current-universal-time&quot;, or &quot;current-date&quot;.
&gt;


Sorry, I missed the last Scheme Naming Convention--when was it held?
Seriously, I don't have a problem changing the names, but perhaps you
could point out a &quot;here's how to name Scheme procedures&quot; document; I'd
appreciate it.

&gt; 3) Why limit the resolution of the time datatype to 1 second?
&gt; The resolution should be implementation dependent, and if you insist,
&gt; of at least 1 second resolution.  This is so that an implementation
&gt; can use the time datatype for finer resolution timing (such
&gt; as a &quot;(thread-sleep! wakeup-time)&quot; procedure I am considering for
&gt; my thread SRFI).  Otherwise, to do finer resolution timing you need
&gt; another time datatype, and this is rather clumsy.
&gt;

The main reason is just that bug-a-boo of mine to be consistent with
Common Lisp; I'll reconsider this. I've found the CL approach clumsy in
just this way.


&gt; 4) I don't like the fact that the &quot;year&quot; component has a special
&gt; meaning between 0 and 99:
&gt;
&gt;     Year, an integer representing the year C.E. (i.e., A.D.). If the
&gt;     integer is between 0 and 99, however, it represents the current
&gt;     year + the year (if it is less than 50) or the current year - the
&gt;     year (if it is greater than or equal to 50).
&gt;
&gt; This is because the meaning of a date created with
&gt; encode-universal-time will depend on the time when that procedure was
&gt; called, and since there is no way to know precisely at what time it
&gt; was called there are (extreme) situations where the time meant is
&gt; not clear (i.e. meaning of year 50 at the turn of the year 2000 plus
&gt; or minus a few nanoseconds may be 1950 or 2050).
&gt;

More Consistency With Common Lisp (CWCL). Still, I'm willing to drop
this.

&gt; 5) Instead of the &quot;multiple value&quot; interface of decode-universal-time
&gt; I prefer single-value accessors of the kind:
&gt;
&gt;   (universal-time-second ut)
&gt;   (universal-time-minute ut)
&gt;   ...
&gt;
&gt; and also (universal-time-second ut) would return a real, possibly
&gt; inexact.
&gt;

Maybe. Perhaps you could give me reason beyond 'I prefer'?

&gt; 6) Why use 1-1-1900 as a base, why not 1-1-1970 which is the norm
&gt; under UNIX?  I know this is a convention, but a closer base date gives
&gt; more implementation leaway... for example a 2 fixnum representation
&gt; (32 bit words, 3 tag bits) counting nanoseconds since 1-1-1900 will
&gt; wraparound in 1991 but if you count from 1-1-1970 it will wraparound
&gt; in 2061, which is probably reasonable for many applications.  And if
&gt; you insist on 1-1-1900, please consider 1-1-2000 at least.
&gt;

Again, CWCL. 1-1-2000 seems like a poor choice because time isn't
defined before this number. 1-1-1970 might be fine.

&gt; 7) The time datatype should be abstract, i.e. it shouldn't be
&gt; a number.  There should be conversion functions between time and
&gt; seconds since the base time:
&gt;
&gt;   (universal-time-&gt;seconds ut)
&gt;   (seconds-&gt;universal-time secs)
&gt;
&gt; Note again that the result of universal-time-&gt;seconds and the
&gt; argument of seconds-&gt;universal-time should be a real, possibly
&gt; inexact.
&gt;

The main reason is insist that it be a number is one can use standard
mathematical operators on them, without converting. You don't need a
special time&gt;, etc.


&gt;
&gt; [Useful implementation notes snipped]
&gt;
&gt; Marc
&gt;

I think the most crucial question Marc's note raises is whether time
(especially 'universal time') should be an abstract data type or a
number; and, if a number, whether it should be a real or an integer. I'd
be glad to hear others' ideas.
