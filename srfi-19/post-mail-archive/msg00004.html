<pre>DR. WILLIAMS BANIGO
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT,
LAGOS, NIGERIA
Email:  banigo@xxxxxxxxxxxx

             URGENT   &amp;   CONFIDENTIAL
Best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my 
proposal as contained in this letter.Before going into details of my proposal to you, 
I must first solicit you to treat it with  utmost confidentiality, as this is required for 
its success.

My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of Nigeria?s 
Contracts Review Panel who are interested in diverting some funds that are 
presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria.In order to 
commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer 
into your account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the 
transfer before the end of this financial quarter.

The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime, government 
officials awarded contracts that were grossly over-invoiced to Contractors.The 
present civilian government set up the Contract Review Panel, which has the 
mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree 
setting up the panel,  to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who 
are being owed outstanding amounts.

My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are 
presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would 
like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue of our positions 
as civil servants and  members of this panel,we cannot acquire these funds in our 
names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore 
been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a 
reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of 
U.S.$16,500,000.00(sixteen Million,five hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars). That is 
why I am writing you this letter.

We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account,
if you agree with our proposition as follows;

(i) 10% to the account owner (you).

(ii) 80% for us (the panel officials).

(iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us )incidental to the 
actualisation of this project.

We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock 
markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them. 
Please note that this transactionis 100% safe and risk-free.We intend to effect 
the transfer within a few days from the date of receipt of the following information:

Your name, company?s name, address and telephone and fax numbers, and your 
banking information. The above information will enable us write letters of claim 
andjob description respectively. This way, we will use your company?s name to 
apply for the payment and backdate the  award of the contract to your company.

We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your 
utmost confidentiality in this transaction. Please acknowledge the receipt of this 
letter and, I will bring you into a more detailed
picture of this transaction when I hear from you.

Best regards,
Dr. Williams Banigo
