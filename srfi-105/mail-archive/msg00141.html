<pre>Mark H Weaver said:
&gt; I recently wrote a preliminary implementation of SRFI-105 for Guile 2.0

Thanks VERY MUCH!! That's awesome.

&gt; and found a few places where the clarity of the specification could be
&gt; improved.

Thanks for the feedback!


&gt; 
&gt; First, the definition of neoteric expressions states that they &quot;recurse
&gt; within lists, so lists contains sequences of zero or more neoteric
&gt; expressions, not s-expressions.&quot;  I take this to mean that:
&gt; 
&gt;    { (f (g h(x))) }   ---&gt;  (f (g (h x)))   NOT   (f (g h (x)))

Yes, that's the intent.

&gt; However, it does not clarify whether neoteric expressions recurse within
&gt; vector literals:
&gt; 
&gt;    { (f #(g h(x))) }  ---&gt;  (f #(g (h x)))   OR   (f #(g h (x)))  ??
&gt; 
&gt; The same question will arise for any other kind of literal that supports
&gt; symbolic elements, such a record literals or hash-table literals, for
&gt; implementations that support them.  Although I would not expect this
&gt; SRFI to impose requirements for handling on non-standard literals, it
&gt; might still be helpful to make recommendations to encourage uniformity
&gt; among implementations.

You're absolutely right, we need to address that.

Alan Manuel Gloria says:
&gt; My gut instinct is &quot;it's still neoteric in vector literals&quot; i.e.
&gt; vectors in n-expression position MUST contain n-expressions.

I agree.  In fact, the sample implementation *specifically* implements neoteric-expresions within vectors, so:
 {#(1 2 f(a) 4)}
maps to:
 #(1 2 (f a) 4)

I'll modify the spec to clarify that, including that example.

Alan Manuel Gloria says:
&gt; I think I'd also clarify that any other literals specific to an implementation
&gt; SHOULD also support n-expressions in places that they support
&gt; s-expressions, if the literal is in n-expression position.

Agree.  I'll add that.

Mark H Weaver said:
&gt; Another issue I ran into relates to datum comments of the form:
&gt; 
&gt;    #;&lt;whitespace&gt;&lt;datum&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; as specified in the R6RS and R7RS (draft 6).  What kind of syntax should
&gt; be used to parse &lt;datum&gt; within such a comment?  I think it's fairly
&gt; clear that &lt;datum&gt; should be parsed the same way as it would have been
&gt; if the &quot;#;&quot; was removed.  It would be good to add a note and an example
&gt; to clarify this.  For example:
&gt; 
&gt;    { (f #;g(x) h(x)) }  ---&gt;  (f (h x))   NOT   (f (x) (h x))


Alan Manuel Gloria says:
&gt;My gut instinct is to say &quot;yes, datum comments should consume
&gt;n-expressions if they are found in n-expression position&quot;.

I agree with that, too.  I'll add a note, and the example listed above.

&gt; Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I would strongly encourage you to
&gt; add many more examples (along with their s-expression equivalents) to
&gt; cover every supported syntax, including all of the edge cases that
&gt; implementors might conceivably get wrong.  This would not only help
&gt; readers clearly understand the spec, but also help ensure that SRFI-105
&gt; syntax is read the same way by all implementations.  If slightly
&gt; incompatible implementations became widely deployed, it could be
&gt; disastrous for adoption of SRFI-105.

Okay.  I'll probably steal more examples from the test suite we have in the readable project.  There's an endless number of tests one can create, but a larger test suite combined with a hopefully clear spec is a good thing.

&gt; Thanks for your work on this!

And thank YOU, very much, for your work.  I think SRFI-105 has to be available on many implementations to be really useful, and your work is a critical part of that.
